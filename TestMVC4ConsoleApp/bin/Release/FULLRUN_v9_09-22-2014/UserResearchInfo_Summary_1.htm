The goal of one of the projects in my laboratory is to understand how DNA polymerases synthesize DNA accurately, and how they make mistakes that result in mutations. We study DNA mammalian DNA polymerase beta (Pol ÃŸ) because it was a relatively small, single subunit enzyme that could be easily manipulated and purified. My laboratory developed a method for assessing the activity and accuracy of rat Pol ÃŸ in bacteria. This led to the identification of a number of variants of Pol ÃŸ that synthesized DNA inaccurately. Our focus upon detailed biochemical characterization of variants of the Pol ÃŸ protein has shown that single amino acid residues that are quite distant from the active site of the enzyme are very important for accurate DNA synthesis. We found that many of these residues act at a distance in DNA positioning, nucleotide binding, and by influencing the rates of conformational changes that are important for accurate DNA synthesis. A second project is focused upon tumor-associated variants of Pol ÃŸ. Pol ÃŸ functions in base excision repair. The base excision repair system is responsible for removal of at least 10,000 DNA lesions per day. Interestingly, the Pol ÃŸ gene appears to be mutated in a large percentage of tumors. We have found that expression of the tumor-associated variants in mouse cells results in cellular transformation that has a mutational mechanism. We have shown that some of the Pol ÃŸ variants synthesize DNA inaccurately and others have no catalytic activity, but can bind to DNA and interfere with its repair. Our results suggest that the variants compromise base excision repair and lead to the induction of mutations, and suggest that base excision repair itself is a tumor suppressor mechanism.

Dr. Wackersâ€™ interest is specifically directed towards cardiac imaging of patients with acute ischemic syndromes: acute infarction and unstable angina. Radionuclide imaging is an intrinsically quantitative methodology since emanated photons generate digital image data. Quantification of images is of clinical importance since the degree of abnormalities is directly related to patientsÂ¹ prognosis and outcomes.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Work in our laboratory has shown that acute ischemia can reliably be detected by noninvasive imaging of intravenously administered radiotracers that accumulate in the heart proportional to blood flow. In acute heart attacks the area at risk for infarction can be visualized and quantified. The results and effectiveness of interventions that restore blood flow can thus be quantified noninvasively as well. We have pioneered the use of radionuclide imaging for evaluating and triaging patients with acute chest pain in the emergency department.

how familiesâ€™ expectations for treatment and their perceptions related to
treatment barriers may shape their overall experience. Within the Yale Child

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Endogenous free radicals and environmental agents such as ionizing radiation induce DNA double-strand breaks. The repair of these breaks is crucial for the maintenance of genome stability. Two distinct pathways help eliminate DNA double-strand breaks. In homologous recombination, the repair of a broken DNA molecule requires an intact homologous duplex to direct the process. Alternatively, a pathway known as non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) simply rejoins the ends of the broken DNA molecule. Our research efforts focus on delineating the mechanisms of these two DNA repair pathway.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Repair by homologous recombination <span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>The recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks is mediated by a group of genes called the RAD52 epistasis group. In mammals, the efficiency of recombinational DNA repair is modulated by the tumour suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2, providing compelling evidence that this repair pathway functions to suppress cancer formation.

Our program seeks to bridge the gap between human laboratory studies examining the medical safety and potential efficacy of new medications for substance dependence and outpatient trials directly examining these medications in drug relapse. Among the key findings is our work on sex and menstrual cycle influences on cocaine responses in humans.

methods the impact of acute administration of stimulants on impulsivity and
related behavioral constructs (compulsivity, reward prediction error, psychosis
vulnerability and stress). Concurrent with this work, we have developed an
interest in the role of neuropeptides (e.g., orexin and leptin) in mediating
relapse to stimulant abuse, and the potential therapeutic actions / mechanism
of the wakefulness promoting agent and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, modafinil.
Finally, in collaboration with Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, we are
conducting a study of the genetics of opioid and methamphetamine dependence in
a northern Thai (Hmong) hill tribe population.<ins class='diffins'> </ins>

Coupled with pharmacological manipulation or stimulation, PET imaging is capable of probing the abnormality in the neurotransmission system functions under diseased conditions.

Dr. Adriana L. GonzÃ¡lez has been involved in research and
clinical interventions with maltreated children and their families.  Her research interests emphasize
developmental psychopathology perspectives that focus in the interplay between
normal and atypical development, the developmental consequences of child
maltreatment, and the study of attachment relationships, including their relation to
the development of the self and psychopathology across development.  Dr. GonzÃ¡lezâ€™s clinical interventions are
derived from an ecological-transactional model that underscores the importance

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[For most of my research career, I have focused on the
processes of synthesis, trafficking and exocytosis of secretory
proteins from the pancreatic acinar cell which has served as the
paradigm for examining the â€œIntracellular Aspects of the Process of
Protein Secretionâ€*. My early work as a graduate student with George
Palade at the Rockefeller University was involved in defining the role
of the Golgi complex in the process which culminates in the formation
of zymogen granules. Subsequently, among other topics, my laboratory
examined the development and regulation of exocytosis of secretory
proteins from the acinar cell, membrane biogenesis and polarity in
epithelial cells, and the relationship of cell polarity to the basement
membrane. 
 Later work on this topic examined in
detail the role of low Mr GTPases in regulated exocytosis. Since
regulated exocytosis is accompanied by compensatory endocytosis of
excess membrane inserted into the apical plasmalemma, we went on to
illustrate an essential role of the actin cytoskeleton in this process
and have demonstrated that proteins required for formation of endocytic
vesicles (clathrin, adaptors, dynamin etc.) assemble at sites of
exocytosis prior to compensatory membrane retrieval.
  After
more than 30 years carrying out cell biologic research with an
impressive and accomplished group of graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows, I decided to close my laboratory in 2001 in order to focus my
interests on teaching Cell Biology and Histology to first-year medical
students.  As part of my teaching interest, I also direct the MD/PhD Program at Yale University School of Medicine.

Dr. Duncan's methodology makes use of mathematical models related to the motion of 3-D elastically deformable objects and is adaptable to the nonlinear, non-rigid regional motion of the LV.</p><p align="left" style="font-size: 12px; ">Development of decentralized approaches for forming complete, integrated computer vision/image analysis systems. Dividing computer vision and image analysis systems into modular hierarchies is useful computationally and also allows to model particular image understanding tasks better. Hierarchical systems are necessary to perform such complex tasks as recognizing anatomy, quantifying the shape and motion of the heart, or performing an integrated segmentation of anatomical structures using multiple imaging modalities. He has recently developed an approach based on the mathematical concept of game theory, where functionals representing each module's tasks both compete and cooperate to make decisions about particular image analysis goals.</p>

Using state-of-the art techniques in chemical profiling by mass spectrometry, we are exploring alterations in the metabolome (entire profile of small molecule metabolites) in brain microdialysis fluids and blood samples from patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Changes in specific metabolites detected during the initial profiling will be further validated as potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for this disease. We are also investigating the role of glutamate, glutamine synthetase and astrocytes in the causation of epilepsy. Patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy have remarkably high levels of the excitatory and toxic amino acid glutamate in their brain. Recent studies by us have indicated that the glutamate overflow in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy may be due to a loss of the enzyme glutamine synthetase in astrocytes of the epileptic brain (Eid et al., Lancet 2004; 363: 28-37). An important goal of our research is to define the relationships among the loss of glutamine synthetase, brain glutamate concentrations, epileptic seizures and epilepsy-related brain damage. To this end we are using a variety of techniques such as simultaneous brain microdialysis and video-intracranial EEG monitoring, 13C- and 15N-isotope labeling studies combined with mass spectrometry and immunogold electron microscopy.

Numerous studies have identified two broad classes of axon growth inhibitor (AGI) proteins responsible for axon growth arrest, the myelin associated inhibitors (Nogo, MAG, OMgp) and the Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans (CSPGs). Experimental paradigms that negate the activity of these inhibitors in vivo have shown a slight increase in regeneration of damaged axons, but a more dramatic restitution of function. An alternative hypothesis to long-distance axon regeneration-mediated restitution of function would be the reorganization of intact spinal circuitry that often remains after SCI. One of the central goals of my laboratory is to comprehensively evaluate the potential for intact spinal circuits to replace lost connections after SCI, and furthermore define whether negating the action of AGIs supports adaptive or maladaptive axonal reorganization. Complex wiring of the myriad phenotypes of ascending, descending and intrinsic spinal tracts points to tract-specific sensitivity to AGIâ€™s.  Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the ability of intact axons to initiate a growth response to adjacent trauma is crucial to the design of therapeutic agents that can either enhance or arrest this response depending on need. Exploiting the plastic potential of intact spinal circuits will offer additional therapeutic tools to encourage restitution of function after CNS injury.

In pathology, however, dendritic spine plasticity appears maladaptive. Dendritic spine morphology (i.e., shape, number, and location) can determine the quality and magnitude of electrical information as it is relayed through neuronal circuits. In a larger sense, spine architecture can influence how the nervous system functions.</p>

Advances
in high-throughput biology and biotechnology have led to an array of biological
insights in medicine, agriculture, evolutionary biology and studies of diverse
organisms. Harnessing the potential of species diversity makes biological
systems ideal to solve defining challenges, such as producing new drugs to
alleviate human disease and generating biologically derived fuels, chemicals
and materials to ensure environmental sustainability.  In addition to a thorough understanding of biological
systems, achieving these goals requires safe and programmable control of
biological systems.  In this
regard, scientists have been primarily using standard recombinant DNA
technologies, which have enabled our ability to perform genetics, but on a
limited scale.  Our ability to
measure and modify genetic and biochemical molecules and their interactions in
pathways, cells and the environment remains a defining challenge.  Thus, â€œbasic enabling technologiesâ€
