										<li>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brown specializes in the cognitive assessment of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer&#39;s, MS) and other neurological disorders such as Epilepsy. His research is focused on developing methods to assess visual memory, which included the development of the Brown Location Test that is currently in use at sites within the United States, Australia, and Europe. In addition, he is exploring which tests can be used to differentiate between Alzheimer&#39;s disease and non-Alzheimer&#39;s causes of cognitive decline, particularly those related to complex medical histories; and is particularly interested in studying the effects of cognitive inefficiency secondary to white matter and related abnormalities. In addition, he enjoys teaching students, residents, fellows, and other providers about neuropsychological assessment and how it may be used in their clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His training includes a Neuropsychology and Neuroimaging Fellowship at Dartmouth Medical School, Neuropsychology and Neuroimaging speciality courses at Brigham Young University, his Psychology Doctorate was from Louisiana Tech University, and his Master&#39;s and Undergraduate Degrees are from Kutztown University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paidas is the recipient of The David J. Leffell, M.D. Prize for Clinical Excellence at Yale in 2010, given to one member of the Yale Medical Group annually.  In 2012, Dr. Paidas received the Dean’s Award from the Tufts Medical Alumni Association.   Dr. Paidas is included in the top 1% physician by specialty in the nation according to US News and World Report.  He has been recognized by the March of Dimes and is included in &lt;em&gt;Best Doctors in America&lt;/em&gt;. Dr. Paidas has also received the National Faculty Award by the Counsel on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paidas received his medical degree from Tufts University School of Medicine in 1987 and completed his internship and residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1991 at Pennsylvania Hospital.  In 1993, Dr. Paidas completed a Fellowship in Maternal Fetal Medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. In 2013, Dr. Paidas was awarded a Master of Arts, Honorary Degree, from Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paidas&#39;s career in medicine has focused on women’s health with special emphasis on blood disorders, reproduction, pregnancy complications and the latter’s impact on health and disease.  His activities span direct patient care, translational research and clinical trials. Dr. Paidas’s research has been supported by federal and non- federal funding agencies.  His notable contributions include: description of the regulatory factors of the Protein C system; clinical use of recombinant antithrombin in disease states; elucidation of the subsequent cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular health consequences of hypertensive disorders and preterm delivery in the largest population based studies published to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paidas and collaborators have described the genomic and proteomic effects of Preimplantation Factor (PIF), a novel mammalian embryo derived factor which regulates maternal receptivity to pregnancy and possesses key immune modulatory properties.  Subsequent animal studies using a synthetic analogue of native PIF have shown benefit in animal models related to a variety of immune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and graft versus host disease.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paidas is the lead Prinicipal Investigator of a multicenter preeclampsia treatment clinical trial, entitled Prospective Randomized Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Antithrombin Versus Placebo in Preterm Preeclampsia (PRESERVE-1).  &lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nygaard received his M.D. from Creighton University, and his PhD in Investigative Medicine from Yale University, focusing on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology. He completed intership in Internal Medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital, followed by Neurology residency at the same institution. He was elected chief resident in neurology his final year as a trainee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nygaard is board certified in Neurology (ABPN), and in Behavioral Neurology and Neuropsychiatry (UCNS). He is co-director of the Yale Memory Clinic, and the Associate Chief of the Division of Neurodegenerative Disorders in the Department of Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nygaard’s laboratory focuses mainly on the link between neuronal hyperexcitability and Alzheimer’s disease. During his work on the interaction between prion protein and amyloid-beta (Aβ), he found that blocking the action of Aβ also prevented the emergence of seizures and epileptiform discharges in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. These findings added to a growing body of work suggesting an important role of neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Dr. Nygaard’s laboratory is currently investigating whether reducing this hyperexcitability in various mouse models, can ameliorate or even reverse the cardinal symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., MD began his tenure as Director of Yale Cancer Center and Physician-in-Chief of Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven on April 1, 2009. The Jonathan and Richard Sackler Professor of Medicine, Dr. Lynch is an expert in the treatment of lung cancer with a special interest in personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A member of the Board of Directors for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Dr. Lynch is internationally known for his leadership in the development of novel therapies for the treatment of lung cancer. Using the molecular profile of lung tumors, he and his research team have developed methods to predict a tumor’s response to targeted drugs based on confirmed mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. The resulting information enables oncologists to create treatment plans that more effectively target each patient’s specific tumor type. This kind of customized care, often referred to as personalized medicine, is a standard of practice at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Lynch is the Chair of the Board of Directors and a founding member of the nationally recognized Kenneth B. Schwartz Center, named after a former patient of his. Currently in 39 states and at over 320 different sites, the Schwartz Center Rounds are multidisciplinary rounds focused on the connection between patients and caregivers to promote compassionate care. The Rounds were brought to Yale Cancer Center in 2007 and continue under Dr. Lynch’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Yale Cancer Center, Dr. Lynch is also overseeing the creation of a new Cancer Biology Institute on Yale’s West Campus, directed by Dr. Joseph Schlessinger. The Institute will encourage collaborative research and will include the fields of cell signaling, cancer immunology, and drug development and target acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to joining Yale, Dr. Lynch served as Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Chief of Hematology/Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center. Dr. Lynch received his undergraduate degree from Yale College in 1982 and his MD degree from Yale School of Medicine in 1986. He completed his internship and residency at MGH, and after serving a fellowship in medical oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute he joined the medical staff at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Lynch is a member of the American Association for Cancer Research, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. He is on the editorial boards of the journal, Clinical Cancer Research, and the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Dr. Lynch has published over 100 original scientific papers and authored or co-authored over 90 review articles and book chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition I developed an inenexpensive instrument to read and report all the tests.  These screens are CE/IVD in Europe and FDA waived in the U.S.  In particular these are the only direct specimen tests for CRE, ciprofloxicin, and ViSA.  See publication list below.  These screens and thei nstrument are marketed by Pilots Point LLC of Sarasota Florida (www.pilotspoint.net).  I am senior partner at Pilots Point.

The World Health Organizationestimates that 24% of overall disease burden is attributable to modifiableenvironmental factors. For example, there are known adverse health effects fromexposure to air pollution, lead, pesticides, mercury, and other toxicsubstances. We need know more about how people think about environmental healthhazards and how this leads them to action to reduce risks - especially amongthose who are most affected. My goal is to help bridge the gap between theworld of health professionals and the world of environmental activists in waysof perceiving and responding to environmental health hazards, in order tobetter support individuals and communities in solving their environmentalhealth problems. ”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;
