										<li><p>Dr. Brown specializes in the cognitive assessment of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, MS) and other neurological disorders such as Epilepsy. His research is focused on developing methods to assess visual memory, which included the development of the Brown Location Test that is currently in use at sites within the United States, Australia, and Europe. In addition, he is exploring which tests can be used to differentiate between Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's causes of cognitive decline, particularly those related to complex medical histories; and is particularly interested in studying the effects of cognitive inefficiency secondary to white matter and related abnormalities. In addition, he enjoys teaching students, residents, fellows, and other providers about neuropsychological assessment and how it may be used in their clinical practice.</p>
<p>His training includes a Neuropsychology and Neuroimaging Fellowship at Dartmouth Medical School, Neuropsychology and Neuroimaging speciality courses at Brigham Young University, his Psychology Doctorate was from Louisiana Tech University, and his Master's and Undergraduate Degrees are from Kutztown University of Pennsylvania.</p>

In 2013, Dr. Paidas was awarded a Master of Arts, Honorary Degree, from Yale University.</p>
<p>Dr. Paidas's career in medicine has focused on women&rsquo;s health with special emphasis on blood disorders, reproduction, pregnancy complications and the latter&rsquo;s impact on health and disease.  His activities span direct patient care, translational research and clinical trials. Dr. Paidas&rsquo;s research has been supported by federal and non- federal funding agencies.  His notable contributions include: description of the regulatory factors of the Protein C system; clinical use of recombinant antithrombin in disease states; elucidation of the subsequent cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular health consequences of hypertensive disorders and preterm delivery in the largest population based studies published to date.</p>
<p>Dr. Paidas and collaborators have described the genomic and proteomic effects of Preimplantation Factor (PIF), a novel mammalian embryo derived factor which regulates maternal receptivity to pregnancy and possesses key immune modulatory properties.  Subsequent animal studies using a synthetic analogue of native PIF have shown benefit in animal models related to a variety of immune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and graft versus host disease.  </p>
<p>Dr. Paidas is the lead Prinicipal Investigator of a multicenter preeclampsia treatment clinical trial, entitled Prospective Randomized Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Antithrombin Versus Placebo in Preterm Preeclampsia (PRESERVE-1).  </p>

He is an elected Fellow of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. </p>
<p>Dr. Redmond directs the Neural Transplant and Regeneration Program, a component of the Yale Department of Psychiatry that researches cellular and viral repair strategies for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The division has an illustrious history, having been among the first groups to use fetal mesencephalic grafts in parkinsonian primates.  Current approaches to neural replacement and repair include the transplantation of fetal tissue, gene delivery using regulatable viral vectors, administration of trophic factors, and the use of embryonic and adult-derived neural stem cells in animal models of Parkinson's disease and other CNS disorders. Dr. Redmond has received numerous scientific grants to support his research and has published over 350 scientific papers.

										<li><p>Dr. Nygaard received his M.D. from Creighton University, and his PhD in Investigative Medicine from Yale University, focusing on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) pathophysiology. He completed intership in Internal Medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital, followed by Neurology residency at the same institution. He was elected chief resident in neurology his final year as a trainee.</p>
<p>Dr. Nygaard is board certified in Neurology (ABPN), and in Behavioral Neurology and Neuropsychiatry (UCNS). He is co-director of the Yale Memory Clinic, and the Associate Chief of the Division of Neurodegenerative Disorders in the Department of Neurology.</p>
<p>Dr. Nygaard&rsquo;s laboratory focuses mainly on the link between neuronal hyperexcitability and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. During his work on the interaction between prion protein and amyloid-beta (A&beta;), he found that blocking the action of A&beta; also prevented the emergence of seizures and epileptiform discharges in a mouse model of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. These findings added to a growing body of work suggesting an important role of neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Dr. Nygaard&rsquo;s laboratory is currently investigating whether reducing this hyperexcitability in various mouse models, can ameliorate or even reverse the cardinal symptoms of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
