										<li><p>Dr. Brown specializes in the cognitive assessment of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, MS) and other neurological disorders such as Epilepsy. His research is focused on developing methods to assess visual memory, which included the development of the Brown Location Test that is currently in use at sites within the United States, Australia, and Europe. In addition, he is exploring which tests can be used to differentiate between Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's causes of cognitive decline, particularly those related to complex medical histories; and is particularly interested in studying the effects of cognitive inefficiency secondary to white matter and related abnormalities. In addition, he enjoys teaching students, residents, fellows, and other providers about neuropsychological assessment and how it may be used in their clinical practice.</p>
<p>His training includes a Neuropsychology and Neuroimaging Fellowship at Dartmouth Medical School, Neuropsychology and Neuroimaging speciality courses at Brigham Young University, his Psychology Doctorate was from Louisiana Tech University, and his Master's and Undergraduate Degrees are from Kutztown University of Pennsylvania.</p>
