										<li><p>Dr. Brown specializes in the cognitive assessment of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, MS) and other neurological disorders such as Epilepsy. His research is focused on developing methods to assess visual memory, which included the development of the Brown Location Test that is currently in use at sites within the United States, Australia, and Europe. In addition, he is exploring which tests can be used to differentiate between Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's causes of cognitive decline, particularly those related to complex medical histories; and is particularly interested in studying the effects of cognitive inefficiency secondary to white matter and related abnormalities. In addition, he enjoys teaching students, residents, fellows, and other providers about neuropsychological assessment and how it may be used in their clinical practice.</p>
<p>His training includes a Neuropsychology and Neuroimaging Fellowship at Dartmouth Medical School, Neuropsychology and Neuroimaging speciality courses at Brigham Young University, his Psychology Doctorate was from Louisiana Tech University, and his Master's and Undergraduate Degrees are from Kutztown University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Dr. Paidas is the recipient of The David J. Leffell, M.D. Prize for Clinical Excellence at Yale in 2010, given to one member of the Yale Medical Group annually.  In 2012, Dr. Paidas received the Dean&rsquo;s Award from the Tufts Medical Alumni Association.   Dr. Paidas is included in the top 1% physician by specialty in the nation according to US News and World Report.  He has been recognized by the March of Dimes and is included in <em>Best Doctors in America</em>. Dr. Paidas has also received the National Faculty Award by the Counsel on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology.  </p>
<p>Dr. Paidas received his medical degree from Tufts University School of Medicine in 1987 and completed his internship and residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1991 at Pennsylvania Hospital.  In 1993, Dr. Paidas completed a Fellowship in Maternal Fetal Medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. In 2013, Dr. Paidas was awarded a Master of Arts, Honorary Degree, from Yale University.</p>
<p>Dr. Paidas's career in medicine has focused on women&rsquo;s health with special emphasis on blood disorders, reproduction, pregnancy complications and the latter&rsquo;s impact on health and disease.  His activities span direct patient care, translational research and clinical trials. Dr. Paidas&rsquo;s research has been supported by federal and non- federal funding agencies.  His notable contributions include: description of the regulatory factors of the Protein C system; clinical use of recombinant antithrombin in disease states; elucidation of the subsequent cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular health consequences of hypertensive disorders and preterm delivery in the largest population based studies published to date.</p>
<p>Dr. Paidas and collaborators have described the genomic and proteomic effects of Preimplantation Factor (PIF), a novel mammalian embryo derived factor which regulates maternal receptivity to pregnancy and possesses key immune modulatory properties.  Subsequent animal studies using a synthetic analogue of native PIF have shown benefit in animal models related to a variety of immune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and graft versus host disease.  </p>
<p>Dr. Paidas is the lead Prinicipal Investigator of a multicenter preeclampsia treatment clinical trial, entitled Prospective Randomized Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Antithrombin Versus Placebo in Preterm Preeclampsia (PRESERVE-1).  </p>
<p>Dr. Paidas has expertise in prenatal ultrasound, invasive fetal diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.  His academic profile includes over 500 published manuscripts, abstracts, books, chapters, presentations or courses.</p>

He was a research resident at the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute, Chicago, and held a fellowship with the National Institute of Mental Health, Laboratory of Clinical Science (1972-74).  He came to Yale in 1974 and has been Professor of Psychiatry since 1986.  He has served as President of the American Society for Neural Therapy and Repair (2002-03) from which he received the 2011 Bernard Sandberg Memorial Award for Brain Repair. He is an elected Fellow of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. </p>
<p>Dr. Redmond directs the Neural Transplant and Regeneration Program, a component of the Yale Department of Psychiatry that researches cellular and viral repair strategies for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The division has an illustrious history, having been among the first groups to use fetal mesencephalic grafts in parkinsonian primates.  Current approaches to neural replacement and repair include the transplantation of fetal tissue, gene delivery using regulatable viral vectors, administration of trophic factors, and the use of embryonic and adult-derived neural stem cells in animal models of Parkinson's disease and other CNS disorders. Dr. Redmond has received numerous scientific grants to support his research and has published over 350 scientific papers. Dr. Redmond was supported by NIH as a &ldquo;Research Career Scientist&rdquo; for the maximum allowed period of 20 years.</p>

										<li><p>Dr. Nygaard received his M.D. from Creighton University, and his PhD in Investigative Medicine from Yale University, focusing on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) pathophysiology. He completed intership in Internal Medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital, followed by Neurology residency at the same institution. He was elected chief resident in neurology his final year as a trainee.</p>
<p>Dr. Nygaard is board certified in Neurology (ABPN), and in Behavioral Neurology and Neuropsychiatry (UCNS). He is co-director of the Yale Memory Clinic, and the Associate Chief of the Division of Neurodegenerative Disorders in the Department of Neurology.</p>
<p>Dr. Nygaard&rsquo;s laboratory focuses mainly on the link between neuronal hyperexcitability and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. During his work on the interaction between prion protein and amyloid-beta (A&beta;), he found that blocking the action of A&beta; also prevented the emergence of seizures and epileptiform discharges in a mouse model of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. These findings added to a growing body of work suggesting an important role of neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Dr. Nygaard&rsquo;s laboratory is currently investigating whether reducing this hyperexcitability in various mouse models, can ameliorate or even reverse the cardinal symptoms of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>

In addition I developed an inenexpensive instrument to read and report all the tests.  These screens are CE/IVD in Europe and FDA waived in the U.S.  In particular these are the only direct specimen tests for CRE, ciprofloxicin, and ViSA.  See publication list below.

In addition I developed a rapid test for the detection of total coliforms and Escherichi coli from drinking water, wastewter, and other water sources.  This test allows the detectionof these public health threats within hours rather than days.  They are also maketed by Pilots Point LLC.</p>
<p>I continue to serve on panels and advisory bodies as a health risk expert for the United Nations World Health Organization, US Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration, and others.
