In July of 2005, Dr. Yeckel was promoted to Associate Research Scientist in Internal Medicine/Endocrinology at Yale and Research Scientist at the Pierce Laboratory. In January of 2006, Dr. Yeckel was appointed Assistant Fellow at the Pierce Laboratory.

										<li>										Dr. Yeckel<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> research interests focus on physiological mechanisms of human metabolism in health and disease. After completing masters-level work in exercise physiology at the University of Pittsburgh (1989-1993), she continued her study of human metabolism, using exercise as a model, in her doctoral research at the University of Texas Medical Branch<del class='diffmod'>â€”Galveston</del><ins class='diffmod'>—Galveston</ins> (1996-2001). Working with Dr. Robert Wolfe, Dr. Yeckel extended her interest in whole-body and muscle-specific fat metabolism while learning stable-isotopic tracer methodologies. Subsequently, she came to the Yale University School of Medicine for post-doctoral training with Drs. Sonia Caprio and William Tamborlane (Pediatrics/Pediatric Endocrinology, 2001-2005) and with Dr. Robert Sherwin (Internal Medicine/Endocrinology, 2005-2006). These experiences provided a health perspective on disrupted physiological metabolism as it relates to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in obesity.
