In July of 2005, Dr. Yeckel was promoted to Associate Research Scientist in Internal Medicine/Endocrinology at Yale and Research Scientist at the Pierce Laboratory. In January of 2006, Dr. Yeckel was appointed Assistant Fellow at the Pierce Laboratory.

										<li>										Dr. Yeckel<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> research interests focus on physiological mechanisms of human metabolism in health and disease. After completing masters-level work in exercise physiology at the University of Pittsburgh (1989-1993), she continued her study of human metabolism, using exercise as a model, in her doctoral research at the University of Texas Medical Branch<del class='diffmod'>â€”Galveston</del><ins class='diffmod'>—Galveston</ins> (1996-2001). Working with Dr. Robert Wolfe, Dr. Yeckel extended her interest in whole-body and muscle-specific fat metabolism while learning stable-isotopic tracer methodologies. Subsequently, she came to the Yale University School of Medicine for post-doctoral training with Drs. Sonia Caprio and William Tamborlane (Pediatrics/Pediatric Endocrinology, 2001-2005) and with Dr. Robert Sherwin (Internal Medicine/Endocrinology, 2005-2006). These experiences provided a health perspective on disrupted physiological metabolism as it relates to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in obesity.

										<li>										When Howard Zonana, MD, first became interested in forensic psychiatry, there was little connection between law and psychiatry in the City of New Haven, the State of Connecticut, or the Yale campus.  In the mid-1970's, Dr. Zonana joined up with Marc Rubenstein and Lansing Crane, who were trying to create a forensic psychiatry program that at least looked at the territory.  They created the Yale Law and Psychiatry Division.  <br><br>The Division is part of the Yale School of Medicine Psychiatry Department and Connecticut Mental Health Center. It is made up of four sections <del class='diffmod'>â€“</del><ins class='diffmod'>–</ins> forensic services, the New Haven Court Clinic, the Jail Diversion Program and research and scholarship. The staff includes licensed psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and social workers as well as a training program in Forensic Psychiatry with funding for four fellows chosen annually through a competitive selection process. The work focuses on evaluations for the courts in civil and criminal matters, e.g. competency, criminal responsibility, pre-sentence evaluations, psychic harm.

Shaywitz, M.D. is the Charles and Helen Schwab Professor in Dyslexia and Learning Development, Chief of Pediatric Neurology and Co-Director of the Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity at the Yale University School of Medicine. Both a child neurologist and neuroscientist,  Shaywitz is a leader in applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to understand the neurobiology of reading and dyslexia in children and adults.  These studies identify a neural signature for dyslexia, making a previously hidden disability visible, and for the first time demonstrate the brain basis for the accommodation of extra time needed by dyslexic readers on high-stakes standardized tests.

His special clinical interests include patients with type 1 diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, complicated type 2 diabetes patients, and hypoglycemia associated with diabetes. Dr Sherwinâ€™s research activities span clinical and basic research and are focused on glucose counterregulation and the immune mechanisms leading to type 1 diabetes mellitus. The studies dealing with counter regulation examine the brain glucose sensing mechanisms mediating the activation of counterregulatory responses and the impact of hypoglycemia and insulin on brain function and metabolism. Research in immunology has led to the isolation of islet-specific T cell clones from diabetic mice that adoptively transfer diabetes and studies of an islet protein linked to islet regeneration. Dr. Sherwin has served as President of the American Diabetes Association and as a member of the FDA Advisory Committee for Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs.

From 1976 to 1978, he completed a fellowship in the Department of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1978 to 1988, he was a professor in the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford University. Dr. Rothman was the E.R. Squibb Professor of Molecular Biology at Princeton University (1988-1991). He founded and chaired the Department of Cellular Biochemistry and Biophysics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (1991-2004), where he held the Paul A. Marks Chair and served as Vice-Chairman of Sloan-Kettering. Prior to coming to Yale in 2008, Dr. Rothman was the Wu Professor of Chemical Biology in the Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, and Director of Columbia Universityâ€™s Sulzberger Genome Center. <br><br> Professor Rothman discovered key molecular machinery responsible for transfer of materials among compartments within cells, providing the conceptual framework for understanding such diverse and important processes as the release of insulin into the blood, communication between nerve cells in the brain, and the entry of viruses to infect cells. Numerous kinds of tiny membrane-enveloped vesicles ferry packets of enclosed cargo. Each type of vesicle must deliver its specialized cargo to the correct destination among the maze of distinct compartments that populate the cytoplasm of a complex animal cell.  The delivery process, termed membrane fusion, is fundamental for physiology and medicine, as pathology in this process can cause metabolic, neuropsychiatric and other diseases.  Rothman reconstituted vesicle budding and fusion in a cell-free system (1984) and discovered the complex of SNARE proteins (1993) which mediates membrane fusion and affords it specificity.  He also uncovered the GTPase-switch mechanism which controls coated vesicle budding in the cell (1991). <br><br>Rothman has also contributed to other fields.  Together with Gero Miesenbock, he showed how patterns of synaptic activity in neural networks could be recorded optically using encoded synapto-pHlourins (1998).  He discovered that hsp70â€™s are ATPases (1986) and peptide binding proteins (1989), thereby revealing how these molecular chaperones cycle on and off proteins to control their folding/unfolding. On theoretical grounds, he proposed (1981) that the role of the Golgi is to iteratively purify proteins, using its cisternae like plates in a distillation tower, an idea now implicit in all models of Golgi dynamics; and he provided the first evidence of sequential processing and vectorial transport across the stack (1981-1985).  Rothmanâ€™s current research concerns the biophysics of membrane fusion and its regulation in exocytosis; the dynamics of the Golgi apparatus at super-resolution; and the use of bio-inspired design in nanotechnology.	 <br><br>Dr. Rothman has received numerous awards and honors in recognition of his work on vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion, including the King Faisal International Prize for Science (1996), the Gairdner Foundation International Award (1996), the Lounsbery Award of the National Academy of Sciences (1997), the Heineken Foundation Prize of the Netherlands Academy of Sciences (2000), the Louisa Gross Horwitz prize of Columbia University (2002), the Lasker Basic Science Award (2002), the Kavli Prize in Neuroscience (2010), the Massry Prize (2010) and the EB.

She has worked with Dr. Grigorenko for approximately 15 years on a number of research projects and has been a member of the EG Lab for the last seven years.  Donna&rsquo;s research projects include investigations into various aspects of learning and reading disabilities; the language acquisition, intellectual ability, and socioemotional development of children adopted from Russia to the United States, and the genetic basis of reading ability in diverse groups.  She has worked closely with the State of Connecticut Court Support Services Division implementing and investigating the effectiveness of a social problem solving skills intervention for children and youth in Connecticut detention centers and while on probation, and another project which examined the challenges encountered in providing children and youth in detention with appropriate and continuous education.  Donna also serves as the Intake Coordinator for the Academic Skills Clinic and assists the clinicians with the clinic&rsquo;s daily operations.  The Yale Academic Skills Clinic is a diagnostic clinic that provides comprehensive psychoeducational/neuropsychological assessments of children and young adults. </p>
