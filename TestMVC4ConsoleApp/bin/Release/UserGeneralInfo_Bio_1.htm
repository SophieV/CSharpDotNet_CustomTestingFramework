										<li>&lt;p&gt;My undergraduate work was in animal science pre vet followed by veterinary school where my emphasis was centered on clinical laboratory animal medicine and research. My interest in mouse pathology started while in veterinary school and continued while working as an oncology scientist and attending veterinarian for a biotech company before leaving to study veterinary pathology full time. Training in comparative pathology followed by a graduate study pathology in intercellular signaling preceded my joining Yale in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary roles at Yale are in the arena of diagnostic and collaborative research veterinary pathology where the primary emphasis is on genetically engineered mice. The collaborations involve working closely with post doctoral research fellows and graduate students in addition to investigators on their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching and training people in rodent necropsy and blood collection are also part of my teaching role for Comparative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own research is centered on the development of the WAG/RijYcb Hemophilia A rat model.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zhang&#39;s research focuses on two areas: 1) etiology and prognosis of adult malignancies; and 2) risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. In particular, she has been pioneering the causes of increasing trends of thyroid cancer observed worldwide. As thyroid cancer is the fifth most common cancer among women in the United States, and factors that are responsible for this increasing trend are largely unknown, there is a critical need to clarify dangers. She is currently leading research activities in these areas as the PI of a population-based case-control study of thyroid cancer in Connecticut and a large nested case-control study of thyroid cancer in the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) cohort. Dr. Zhang has been studying a wide array of environmental exposures, lifestyle factors and gene-environment interaction in the etiology and prognosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She plays a major role in the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph), and her research on hair dye use served as key evidence for IARC Monograph. She has also been studying environment factors and gene-environment interactions for multiple myeloma and cancers of the testes, pancreas, lung, liver, breast, and bladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dr. Zhang became interested in adverse pregnancy outcomes because the fetal origin hypothesis suggests that growth and developmental delays in utero may influence not only childhood mortality and morbidity but also the risk of diseases in adulthood including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Dr. Zhang is currently establishing a birth cohort study in Lanzhou and Taiyuan, China to investigate a wide range of environmental and lifestyle factors, genetic and epigenetic changes, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, and risk of adverse birth outcomes and maternal complications.    &lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;James F. Leckman, M.D. is the Neison Harris Professor of Child Psychiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology and Pediatrics at Yale. He served as the Director of Research for the Yale Child Study Center from 1983 to 2010. Dr. Leckman is a well known child psychiatrist and patient-oriented clinical investigator. His peers have regularly selected him as one of the Best Doctors in America. Dr. Leckman is the author or co-author of over 300 original articles published in peer-reviewed journals, seven books, and 120 book chapters. In 2002, he was identified by American Society for Information, Science and Technology as a “Highly Cited Researcher” - one of the world&#39;s most cited authors in Psychology and Psychiatry – in the top half of the top one percent of all publishing researchers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1999, he edited with Dr. Donald J. Cohen, Tourette&#39;s Syndrome: Tics, Obsessions, Compulsions - Developmental Psychopathology and Clinical Care, published by John Wiley&amp;Sons. Given its success, this volume was re-issued in paper back in the fall of 2001. More recently, Dr. Leckman edited (along with Andres Martin, Lawrence Scahill and Dennis Charney) a 56-chapter volume, entitled, Pediatric Psychopharmacology: Principles and Practice published in October of 2002 by Oxford University Press. In November 2002, an invited review article on Tourette’s syndrome appeared in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet. Other recent editorials have appeared in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry (2011), Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011), Neuropsychopharmacology (2011), and the British Medical Journal (2012).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, in partnership with colleagues at UNICEF and the Mother-Child Education Foundation based in Turkey, Dr. Leckman has begun to explore the question whether strengthening families and enhancing child development is a path to peace and violence prevention. Related efforts include the Early Childhood Peace Consortium that was launched (September 2013) in New York in at the United Nations and the 15th Ernst Str&#252;ngmann Forum that took place in Frankfurt, Germany in October 2013. The deliberations of 40 international experts from a broad range of scientific disciplines are summarized in volume entitled, Formative Childhoods: The Transformative Power of Children and Families, published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press in 2014.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., MD began his tenure as Director of Yale Cancer Center and Physician-in-Chief of Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven on April 1, 2009. The Jonathan and Richard Sackler Professor of Medicine, Dr. Lynch is an expert in the treatment of lung cancer with a special interest in personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A member of the Board of Directors for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Dr. Lynch is internationally known for his leadership in the development of novel therapies for the treatment of lung cancer. Using the molecular profile of lung tumors, he and his research team have developed methods to predict a tumor’s response to targeted drugs based on confirmed mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. The resulting information enables oncologists to create treatment plans that more effectively target each patient’s specific tumor type. This kind of customized care, often referred to as personalized medicine, is a standard of practice at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Lynch is the Chair of the Board of Directors and a founding member of the nationally recognized Kenneth B. Schwartz Center, named after a former patient of his. Currently in 39 states and at over 320 different sites, the Schwartz Center Rounds are multidisciplinary rounds focused on the connection between patients and caregivers to promote compassionate care. The Rounds were brought to Yale Cancer Center in 2007 and continue under Dr. Lynch’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Yale Cancer Center, Dr. Lynch is also overseeing the creation of a new Cancer Biology Institute on Yale’s West Campus, directed by Dr. Joseph Schlessinger. The Institute will encourage collaborative research and will include the fields of cell signaling, cancer immunology, and drug development and target acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to joining Yale, Dr. Lynch served as Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Chief of Hematology/Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center. Dr. Lynch received his undergraduate degree from Yale College in 1982 and his MD degree from Yale School of Medicine in 1986. He completed his internship and residency at MGH, and after serving a fellowship in medical oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute he joined the medical staff at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Lynch is a member of the American Association for Cancer Research, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. He is on the editorial boards of the journal, Clinical Cancer Research, and the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Dr. Lynch has published over 100 original scientific papers and authored or co-authored over 90 review articles and book chapters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Jonas received training in Neurology and Internal Medicine. She developed an interest in Neuroscience while studying as a medical student with Dr. Rodolfo Llinas at N.Y.U. and at the Marine Biological Laboratory. With Dr. Llinas she developed an interest in calcium control of synaptic transmission. She pursued this interest as a post-doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Leonard Kaczmarek, Yale Pharmacology. She studied an intracellular calcium store necessary for secretion of reproductive hormones in the bag cell neurons of Aplysia californica. While studying these questions, Dr. Jonas developed a technique for recording from ion channels on intracellular membranes and has used this and other techniques to study mitochondria. Mitochondria are necessary for life and death of neurons and other cells. Regulation of mitochondrial metabolism is also key to energy efficiency in the nervous system. Dr. Jonas is now studying the role of mitochondria and energy efficiency in neurodegenerative disease states and in learning and memory formation in healthy brain.&lt;/p&gt;

My work has focused on three major areas: (1) evaluating and refining outcomes of randomized clinical trials, (2) understanding the mechanisms of action of empirically supported therapies for substance use disorders, and (3) development and dissemination of computer-based interventions. I was one of the first to statistically demonstrate coping skills as a mediator of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for substance use disorders, and have evaluated factors that affect the acquisition of coping skills, such as cognitive function. I also participate in various activities, including the Clinical Trials Network (CTN) as a member of a special interest group on Design &amp; Analysis and the publications committee, as well as serving as an expert consultant in CBT and Motivational Interviewing for a multisite clinical trial.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;I am a clinician-scientist with an interest in the matricellular proteins, PEDF and TSP-1, which are best known as inhibitors of angiogenesis. The recent identification of PEDF as the cause of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) Type VI has clarified PEDF biology. Specifically, the phenotypes associated with high PEDF conditions (metabolic syndrome, adiposity) and null PEDF states (OI Type VI) indicate that PEDF functions to regulate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) lineage specification. Based on these clinical insights, we have demonstrated that PEDF can direct MSC fate. This is significant because previous unbiased proteomic screens have postulated PEDF&#39;s role in stem cell pluripotency.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Michael A. Choma, MD, PhD is a physician-scientist with expertise in pediatrics, biomedical optics, and biomedical engineering. His research uses innovative optical imaging methods to better understand and treat pediatric disease, including congenital heart disease and ciliary disease. Michael received his BS in Biomedical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University, his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Duke University (thesis advisor: Joseph Izatt, PhD), and his MD from Duke University. His PhD thesis research into optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-contact optical imaging method that is the optical analogue of ultrasound imaging, contributed to next-generation OCT technologies that enabled a 100 to 1000-fold increase in clinical imaging speeds without compromising image quality or sensitivity. While Michael was a resident in pediatrics at Children&#39;s Hospital Boston, he pursued research in high-speed, high-resolution imaging of embryo hearts as a Visiting Clinical Fellow at the Wellman Center for Photomedicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital (research advisors: Guillermo Tearney, MD, PhD and Brett Bouma, PhD). After training in Boston, Michael came to the Yale School of Medicine to start a biomedical optics lab in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael&#39;s has active research in three areas. First, he develops new laser sources for microscopy and biological imaging. Second, using sophisticated optical imaging methods, he studies abnormal embryonic heart function in different animal models of human disease, including &lt;em&gt;Xenopus&lt;/em&gt; (tadpole) and &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; (fruit fly). In particular, he studies the role that specific human genes play in abnormal embryo heart development and physiology. Third, he develops imaging methods to better diagnose abnormalities in respiratory cilia function. Since cilia expel mucus that contains allergens, viruses, and bacteria, they are essential to keeping lungs healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall impact of Michael&#39;s work is two-fold. First, he is developing core optical technologies that may find widespread use in microscopy. Second, his cilia and heart imaging research has the potential to personalize the diagnosis and treatment of a wide-variety of pediatric diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

Second, using sophisticated optical imaging methods, he studies abnormal embryonic heart function in different animal models of human disease, including <del class='diffmod'>&lt;em&gt;Xenopus&lt;/em&gt;</del><ins class='diffmod'>the</ins> <del class='diffmod'>(tadpole)</del><ins class='diffmod'>tadpole</ins> <del class='diffmod'>and</del><ins class='diffmod'>Xenopus</ins> <del class='diffmod'>&lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; (fruit fly)</del><ins class='diffmod'>tropicalis</ins>. In particular, he studies the role that specific human genes play in abnormal embryo heart development and physiology. Third, he develops imaging methods to better diagnose abnormalities in respiratory cilia function. Since cilia expel mucus that contains allergens, viruses, and bacteria, they are essential to keeping lungs healthy.&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffmod'>

</ins>&lt;p&gt;The overall impact of Michael&#39;s work is two-fold. First, he is developing core optical technologies that may find widespread use in microscopy. Second, his cilia and heart imaging research has the potential to personalize the diagnosis and treatment of a wide-variety of pediatric diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE NOTE: &lt;/strong&gt;On July 2, 2014, President Obama appointed Dr. Handelsman to the position of Associate Director for Science in The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The appointment will last for up to two years. During the time she is working at The White House, her lab at Yale will continue to function under the supervision of two former Handelsman Lab Graduate Students, Dr. Nichole Broderick and Dr. Eric Stabb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jo Handelsman is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor and Frederick Phineas Rose Professor in the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University. She received her Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1984 and she served on the faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1985 until moving to Yale in 2010. Her research focuses on the genetic and functional diversity of microorganisms in soil, plant and insect gut communities. Handelsman’s lab is one of the pioneers of functional metagenomics, an approach to accessing the genetic potential of unculturable bacteria in environmental samples. Their studies using both culture-based and metagenomic analyses have led to discovery of novel antibiotics and determinants of antibiotic resistance and expanded understanding of multispecies interactions that enhance or diminish the health of host animals and plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to her microbiology research program, Handelsman is also known internationally for her efforts to improve science education and increase the participation of women and minorities in science at the university level. She co-founded the Women in Science and Engineering Leadership Institute at UW-Madison, which designed and evaluated interventions intended to enhance the participation of women in science, and founded The Center for Scientific Teaching at Yale, which provides local and national leadership in transforming classroom teaching in science and engineering. Her leadership in education and women in science led to her appointment as the first President of the Rosalind Franklin Society, her service on the National Academies&#39; panel that wrote the 2006 report, &quot;Beyond Bias and Barriers: Fulfilling the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering,&quot; appointment as co-Director of the National Academies Summer Institutes on Undergraduate Education in Biology, and her role as co-chair of a working group that produced the report to President Obama, “Engage to Excel: Producing One Million Additional College Graduates with Degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handelsman has co-authored over 100 scientific papers, 30 editorials, and three books about teaching: &lt;em&gt;Entering Mentoring,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Scientific Teaching, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Biology Brought to Life&lt;/em&gt;. She co-edits the series, &lt;em&gt;Controversies in Science and Technology&lt;/em&gt;. She is a fellow in the American Academy of Microbiology, Wisconsin Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the AAAS; and a member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering. She served as president of American Society for Microbiology in 2013; has received numerous awards in recognition of her mentoring, teaching, and research contributions; and in 2009, Seed Magazine named her &quot;A Revolutionary Mind&quot; in recognition of her unorthodox ideas. In 2011, she was one of 11 individuals selected by President Barack Obama to receive the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring, and in 2012, Nature named her one of “ten people who mattered this year” for her research on gender bias in science.&lt;/p&gt;
