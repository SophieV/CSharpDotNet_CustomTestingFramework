										<li>The research team at the Yale-New Haven Hospital Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE), which I have directed since 1995, continues to expand its role as the chief architect of the national public reporting of hospital performance. We have pioneered new approaches to measurement that are now widely accepted and publicly reported by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). We have provided the scientific basis for these measures and participated in efforts to display them effectively. The measures are also leading to research that is providing insight into key determinants of performance among our nation’s hospitals. We are continuing to develop new measures, with attention to ensuring that they are scientifically strong and relevant to efforts to improve care.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We continue work on a four-year grant funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, UnitedHealthcare, and the Commonwealth Fund to investigate the factors associated with the outstanding performance of hospitals in the care of patients who have had a heart attack. This study was built upon prior work assessing the differentiating features of institutions that excel in specific areas, with the current focus on those hospitals with outstanding records in patient survival. The work is directly related to the CMS measures described above, with the intent of generating knowledge that can be used by poorer performing hospitals in their efforts to improve. Our work in this area is generating attention for an approach that some may call ‘positive deviance.’ The notion is that the wisdom about best practice may already exist within a community of practitioners and hospitals. We need to identify top performance, learn from those who achieve it, test it in rigorous ways, and, if deemed worthy, find ways to disseminate it.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We continue our work as the central analytic center for national databases addressing the use of cardiovascular procedures. We are the lead center for a database that was mandated by CMS, and in this role we are pursuing research that provides insight into the adoption and application of new technology. We are also serving as experts to guide the next generation of these databases.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CORE devotes extensive efforts toward research directed at improving quality of life and outcomes as well as empowering patients through more active participation in their own care. We successfully completed our targeted enrollment in this final year of the “Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes” project, a federally-funded study of an innovative approach to monitor patients with heart failure. This study is the only National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded effort to evaluate disease management in patients with heart failure and will add critical information to inform payment policy.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We completed enrollment and began data analysis for another NIH-funded study designed to characterize the outcomes of patients after a hospitalization for a heart attack, with particular attention to their quality of life and ability to perform daily activities. This study is helping us understand trajectories of recovery experienced by patients after suffering a heart attack, and the determinants of adverse outcomes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We recently completed the final year of a grant from the Commonwealth Fund to evaluate the Door-to-Balloon (D2B) Alliance, designed to produce knowledge that will guide future large-scale national initiatives. During the course of this initiative, we achieved remarkable improvements in the timeliness of the treatment of heart attacks that benefit from emergency angioplasty. We engaged more that 1,000 hospitals in the United States and many others internationally, with gratifying results. We have submitted the final results for publication and expect for this project to be a catalyst for other efforts that target key processes of care. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another major federally funded project, we continue our work to construct an unprecedented database of the experience of Medicare patients over time, with the intent of creating a series of national surveillance studies. In addition, we are working directly with CMS to develop strategies for monitoring healthcare outcomes in the Medicare population.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In mid-2008, we completed the start-up phase and began enrollment for the VIRGO project (www.virgostudy.org), a multi-site five-year study through which we will determine key factors that influence the survival and health of women younger than 55 years of age who suffer heart attacks. Comparing 2,000 women and 1,000 similarly aged men, all of whom have had a heart attack, we will identify how women who have heart attacks differ from men, what factors contribute to premature heart disease in women, how delays in seeking care for a heart attack affect a woman’s risk and outcome, and whether the quality of care received by women is comparable to that of men. In addition to its unique population, the study is novel in that it bridges basic science, clinical science, and social science – and this approach should yield some very interesting findings about what matters most in the successful recovery of such patients.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Tigelaar&#39;s major research focus continues to be the dendritic epidermal d T cells (DETC) populating the skin of all normal strains of mice. A number of longstanding collaborations between the Tigelaar lab and those of Michael Girardi (Dermatology) and Adrian Hayday (Guy’s Immunobiology [London]) include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The generation and characterization of a Vg5-/- “knockout” mouse selectively deficient in DETCs expressing the TCR prototypically seen on &gt;95% of such cells; studies of such mice unexpectedly showed that in the absence of Vg5, the replacement population of d DETC includes a significant number of cells expressing a Vd1/d1 TCR with a similar 3-D conformation as the conventional Vg5/Vd1 TCR (as defined by an anti-clonotypic antibody to the Vg5/Vd1 TCR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation that some (e.g., FVB and NOD), but not other (B6) strains of mice genetically deficient in d T cells (d-/- mice) develop a localized (ears) cutaneous inflammation/ spontaneous dermatitis (SpD) that is dependent (like atopic dermatitis) both upon conventional a&#223; T cells and upon an appropriate external environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoptive transfer studies showed that Vg5+ DETC but not systemic Vg5- d cells were necessary and sufficient to down-regulate SpD. Finally, crosses of susceptible (NOD) and resistant (C57BL/6) d-/- mice which showed that susceptibility to SpD behaves as a recessive trait, have been recently analyzed by genome-wide, microsatellite mapping; these studies clearly indicate that several distinct genetic intervals contribute to the regulation of this cutaneous inflammatory response. Ongoing studies in this arena:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To characterize in more detail the pathology in SpD normally down-regulated by skin-associated DETC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To characterize the genes expressed by “resting” DETC and in vitro “activated” DETC by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To investigate the potentials of selected candidate DETC cytokines/effector molecules to down-regulate SpD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recent studies of a spontaneous mutation arising in a substrain of FVB mice that results in a striking deficiency in the skin of the prototypic Vg5/Vd1+ DETCs seen in other normal mice strains led to further studies that proved that this heritable defect in a dominant gene resided in fetal thymic epithelial cells resulting in a failure of positive selection in the thymus (and subsequent migration to the skin) of the Vg5/Vd1+ fetal thymic precursors. (These results, published in Nature Immunology, present the first definitive proof that d cells resident in epithelial interfaces with the external environment, like conventional recirculating a&#223; T cells, undergo positive selection in the thymus.) In a productive collaborative followup study between Drs. Tigelaar, Girardi and Hayday with Richard Lifton (Genetics) recently published in Nature Genetics, it was shown that this defect is caused by mutation in Skint1, a newly identified gene expressed in thymus and skin that encodes a protein with immunoglobulin-like and transmembrane domains. Skint1 is the prototypic member of a rapidly evolving family of at least 11 genes in mouse, with greatest similarity to the butyrophilin genes. These findings define a new family of proteins mediating key epithelial-immune interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>Research in our laboratory focuses on bone biology with particular emphasis on the fusion mechanism of macrophages, hence the differentiation of osteoclasts and giant cells, and on the targeted formation of new bone. We have kept an interest in studying further the immunosuppressive role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).

&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research in our lab focuses on the differentiation of osteoclasts, which are multinucleated macrophages that resorb bone, with particular emphasis on the fusion mechanism of their precursors that belong to the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. We have generated in vivo and in vitro macrophage fusion assays to clone MFR/SIRPalpha, the expression of which is transiently but highly induced in macrophages at the onset of fusion in vitro and in vivo. We have also reported CD47 as the ligand for MFR, and CD44 as a molecule highly but transiently expressed at the onset of fusion. Most recently, we showed that CD200 is highly expressed in osteoclasts, but only at the onset of fusion of macrophages, which do not express CD200. Our goal is to define the role of these molecules in the fusion of macrophages. We have used genome-wide cDNA microarrays to identify the genes that belong to the fusion machinery. We are in the process of studying the function of several of these genes. The understanding we gained about macrophage-macrophage fusion is being applied to studies on macrophage fusion with tumor cells and with somatic cells, such as hepatocytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the most recent research focus in our lab has been the development of a novel approach to target the formation of new bone to specific skeletal sites. This new technology combines stem cells, nano-material and PTH. We are in the process of translating the data generated in rats into larger animals, such as rabbits, and eventually in humans. We are most interested in studying the molecular mechanisms that mediate the differentiation of osteoblasts, which form new bone in response to mechanical ablation of marrow. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The immunosuppressive role of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), which is a neuropeptide encoded by the same gene as the hormone calcitonin, is a line of research that we still pursue. CGRP shares structural and functional homology with calcitonin. While calcitonin is a calcium regulatory hormone produced by C cells in the thyroid, CGRP is concentrated in sensory nerve endings in all tissues and organs. We reported that CGRP has potent immuno-suppressive activity in vivo, and in vitro by virtue of inhibiting T helper 1 lymphocytes to produce cytokines such as Interleukin 2. By targeting the expression of the CGRP gene to beta cells of the endocrine pancreas of NOD mice, which develop spontaneous diabetes, we have shown that CGRP prevents type I diabetes. This indicates that CGRP acts as a local immunoregulatory peptide. Our goal is to investigate how CGRP controls immune cells function and whether CGRP can be targeted in vivo, using genetic engineering or local delivery, so as to allow for the survival of transplanted organs, and treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/li&gt;

We are most interested in studying the molecular mechanisms that mediate the differentiation of osteoblasts, which form new bone in response to mechanical ablation of marrow. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The immunosuppressive role of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), which is a neuropeptide encoded by the same gene as the hormone calcitonin, is a line of research that we still pursue. CGRP shares structural and functional homology with calcitonin. While calcitonin is a calcium regulatory hormone produced by C cells in the thyroid, CGRP is concentrated in sensory nerve endings in all tissues and organs. We reported that CGRP has potent immuno-suppressive activity in vivo, and in vitro by virtue of inhibiting T helper 1 lymphocytes to produce cytokines such as Interleukin 2. By targeting the expression of the CGRP gene to beta cells of the endocrine pancreas of NOD mice, which develop spontaneous diabetes, we have shown that CGRP prevents type I diabetes. This indicates that CGRP acts as a local immunoregulatory peptide. Our goal is to investigate how CGRP controls immune cells function and whether CGRP can be targeted in vivo, using genetic engineering or local delivery, so as to allow for the survival of transplanted organs, and treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;strong&gt;Future Research:
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Studying the interaction between MFR-CD47, CD44 and CD200 in the fusion of macrophages &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying the genes that regulate the fusion and/or the multinucleation of macrophages, hence the differentiation of osteoclasts and giant cells &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defining the signaling pathways that control the formation of osteoclasts &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate our targeted formation of bone in rats into rabbits &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defining the molecular pathways that lead to the differentiation of osteoblasts in vivo &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;strong&gt;Industrial Relevance:
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Screen for small molecules that block/stimulate osteoclast differentiation / pre-osteoclast fusion / osteoclastic bone resorption &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen for small molecules that stimulate osteoclast apoptosis &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen for small molecules that promote the differentiation of osteoblasts in vivo&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoBodyText&quot; style=&quot;tab-stops: .5in;&quot;&gt;I am primarily interested in host-pathogen interaction, with a focus on RNA viruses &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, I wish to understand pathogenic mechanisms of viral infection at the cellular and animal levels, and study the molecular function of host genes that influence viral pathogenesis and the disease outcomes. On the host side, I am keen on the innate immune system, detection of viruses and initiation of antiviral immune response.  On the virus side, I wish to understand the mechanisms of immune evasion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoBodyText&quot; style=&quot;tab-stops: .5in;&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Flaviviridae&lt;/em&gt; family consists of a large number of ssRNA viruses that cause fatal human diseases.  For example, West Nile virus (WNV) is the culprit of thousands of encephalitis/meningitis cases and deaths since 1999. Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with a mortality of 1–5% if untreated. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects ~3% of the world&#39;s population and causes 350,000 deaths yearly.  I attempt to identify novel host factors that restrict or facilitate virus pathogenesis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. These factors may be regulators of host antiviral immune pathways or participants of viral life cycle including surface receptors mediating viral entry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these disease conditions and virus specific host immune response can advance the development of specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoBodyText&quot; style=&quot;tab-stops: .5in;&quot;&gt;I am primarily interested in host-pathogen interaction, with a focus on RNA viruses &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, I wish to understand pathogenic mechanisms of viral infection at the cellular and animal levels, and study the molecular function of host genes that influence viral pathogenesis and the disease outcomes. On the host side, I am keen on the innate immune system, detection of viruses and initiation of antiviral immune response.  On the virus side, I wish to understand the mechanisms of immune evasion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoBodyText&quot; style=&quot;tab-stops: .5in;&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Flaviviridae&lt;/em&gt; family consists of a large number of ssRNA viruses that cause fatal human diseases.  For example, West Nile virus (WNV) is the culprit of thousands of encephalitis/meningitis cases and deaths since 1999. Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with a mortality of 1–5% if untreated. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects ~3% of the world&#39;s population and causes 350,000 deaths yearly.  I attempt to identify novel host factors that restrict or facilitate virus pathogenesis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. These factors may be regulators of host antiviral immune pathways or participants of viral life cycle including surface receptors mediating viral entry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these disease conditions and virus specific host immune response can advance the development of specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;p&gt;1.

										<li>Our major research interests are investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms and regulation of electrolyte transport in kidney tubules, in particular using genetically manipulated animal models to study their phenotypes. Phenotypes of mutant or knockout animals will provide information on the physiology or pathophysiology of the target proteins. By using transgenic animal models, we can mimic clinical diseases for a better understanding of the mechanisms and treatments of these diseases in humans.&lt;br&gt;	 The major experimental techniques used in this lab include: metabolic studies; renal clearance in rats and mice; microperfusion of the proximal tubule, loop of Henle and distal tubules &lt;EM&gt;in vivo&lt;/EM&gt;; microperfusion of kidney proximal and collecting tubules &lt;EM&gt;in vitro&lt;/EM&gt; in rats and mice; measurement of cell pH; and analysis of Na&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;, Cl&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt;, K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;, HCO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt;  concentrations in nanoliter samples.  Using these methods, we have studied kidney tubule functions and tubule transport in many knockout and transgenic animal models such as NHE3 (the predominant isoform responsible for apical membrane Na&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;/H&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;exchange, which mediates 50 to 60% of Na&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; and HCO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt; absorption in the kidney proximal tubule).  We have also studied eNOS, nNOS, iNOS (endothelial, neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthases, a family of enzymes that synthesizes NO from L-arginine in mammalian tissue and is expressed in the kidney); CEFX (SLC26A6, PAT1, a Cl&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt;-anion exchanger located in the brush border of the proximal tubule, which mediates the principal component of the Cl&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt;-base exchange), PDZK1 (a PDZ-binding domain containing protein identified in kidney, pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and adrenal cortex, which is localized exclusively in the brush border of the proximal tubule and may be capable of interaction with numerous renal proteins including NHE3 and CEFX).  Our research also covers NHERF-1 (NHE regulatory factor, which interacts with cAMP-mediated NHE3 activity); pendrin (the protein product of the &lt;EM&gt;PDS&lt;/EM&gt; gene [SLC26A4], with functions in several different anion exchange modes including chloride/formate exchange), and ROMK knockout mice.

Using these methods, we have studied kidney tubule functions and tubule transport in many knockout and transgenic animal models such as NHE3 (the predominant isoform responsible for apical membrane Na&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;/H&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;exchange, which mediates 50 to 60% of Na&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; and HCO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt; absorption in the kidney proximal tubule).  We have also studied eNOS, nNOS, iNOS (endothelial, neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthases, a family of enzymes that synthesizes NO from L-arginine in mammalian tissue and is expressed in the kidney); CEFX (SLC26A6, PAT1, a Cl&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt;-anion exchanger located in the brush border of the proximal tubule, which mediates the principal component of the Cl&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt;-base exchange), PDZK1 (a PDZ-binding domain containing protein identified in kidney, pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and adrenal cortex, which is localized exclusively in the brush border of the proximal tubule and may be capable of interaction with numerous renal proteins including NHE3 and CEFX).  Our research also covers NHERF-1 (NHE regulatory factor, which interacts with cAMP-mediated NHE3 activity); pendrin (the protein product of the &lt;EM&gt;PDS&lt;/EM&gt; gene [SLC26A4], with functions in several different anion exchange modes including chloride/formate exchange), and ROMK knockout mice.<ins class='diffins'>    Studying flow-activated salt, water and bicarbonate transport in kidney proximal tubules and flow-induced changes in ion transporter function and regulation, to explore the mechanism of glomerulotubular balance (GTB). Briefly, GTB is a critical aspect of proximal tubule transport that maintains nearly proportional change in reabsorption of Na&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;, HCO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt;, Cl&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt; and water with variations in glomerular filtration (GFR). GTB acts to prevent renal solute loss following a GFR increase, and also allows preservation of adequate distal sodium delivery in times of low GFR, thus limiting compromise of distal nephron acid and potassium excretion. We are hoping to determine what the flow sensor is in the proximal tubule; how tubule transport is regulated by flow; how the flow signal can be transduced to the membrane transporters; and how membrane transporter activity is activated by increased tubular flow.&lt;br&gt;    Studying the structure and function of renal potassium channels in the regulation of salt, water and acid-base balance to understand the mechanism of Bartter&#39;s syndrome in humans. Briefly, the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK) is an ATP-sensitive inward-rectifier potassium channel highly expressed in the cortical and medullary thick ascending limbs (TAL), connecting segment (CNT) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) in the mammalian kidney, where it serves to recycle K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; across the apical membrane in TAL and secrete K&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; in the CNT and CCD. ROMK channel mutations cause a type II Bartter&#39;s syndrome with salt wasting and dehydration, and ROMK knockout mice have a similar phenotype to Bartter&#39;s syndrome in humans. We have used the ROMK knockout mice to study electrolyte and acid-base transport along the nephron to understand TAL function under physiological conditions and to explore the compensatory mechanisms of salt and water transport, acid-base balance and blood pressure regulation under the conditions of TAL dysfunction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Core activities:&lt;br&gt;

										<li>										<ins class='diffins'>We are focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie three important biological processes:   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.  ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling by various remodeler complexes.  We have been testing the hypothesis that remodelers contain highly conserved DNA translocase engines by directly measuring their translocation processivity, velocity, step size and force generation. We are studying how the force is transduced to remodel chromatin structures in a tightly regulated manner. Finally, we are investigating how ATP-dependent remodeling activity is affected by histone modifications.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Zhang, Y.L., Smith, C.L., Saha, A., Grill, S.W., Mihardja, S., Smith, S.B., Cairns, B.R., Peterson, C.L., and Bustamantel, C. (2006). DNA translocation and loop formation mechanism of chromatin remodeling by SWI/SNF and RSC. &lt;em&gt;Mol. Cell&lt;/em&gt; 24, 559-568. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saha, A., Wittmeyer, J., and Cairns, B.R. (2006). Chromatin remodeling: the industrial revolution of DNA around histones. &lt;em&gt;Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.&lt;/em&gt; 7: 437-447.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br&gt;2.  Regulated folding and assembly of SNARE proteins involved in membrane fusion.  SNARE proteins are the engines for membrane fusion.  The current model for SNARE function suggests that these proteins generate forces to drive the fusion through an unusual protein zippering mechanism, by which a pair of cognate SNARE proteins (t- and v-SNAREs) progressively fold and assemble to form an extraordinarily stable four-helix bundle. This assembly process is controlled by numerous proteins that regulate the fusion in a spatially- and temporally-specific manner.  We have undertaken to measure the force produced by a single pair of SNAREs and characterize how the force production is regulated by key regulatory proteins involved in synaptic transmission.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Jahn, R., and Scheller, R.H.

Membrane remodeling or fission mediated by dynamin and BAR proteins. Dynamin has long been considered as a mechanochemical enzyme essential for endocytosis including neuronal endocytosis. But its mechanism of action remains controversial. The proposed models suggest that dynamin may twist, pinch, and/or stretch the membrane upon GTP hydrolysis in a concerted manner once many dynamin molecules coat on the membrane. We will characterize the underlying mechanosensing and mechanochemical transmission processes that lead to membrane deformation (such as tube formation) and eventually membrane fission.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Roux, A, Uyhazi, K, Frost A, and De Camilli P.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;We are interested in the molecular and cellular mechanisms that
govern the behavior of stem cells, in particular how they balance the
needs of self-renewal and differentiation during mammalian
organogenesis and tissue maintenance. Current research uses
neurogenesis in mice as a model system to study how neural stem
(progenitor) cells are maintained and how neuronal diversity is
generated in the mammalian nervous system. We are examining whether
Numb-mediated asymmetric cell division represents a mechanism that is
shared by stem cells in many tissues for their progeny to choose
between self-renewal and differentiation. By elucidating how this
mechanism acts together with other cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic
cues to form organs and maintain tissue homeostasis, we hope to
understand the fundamental biology of stem cells and provide insights
for their therapeutic use in repairing or replacing damaged tissues. &lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;Stem
cells, whether of embryonic or adult origin, are defined by the ability
to produce more stem cells (self-renew) and the potential to generate
differentiated offspring for carrying out tissue function. For stem
cells involved in organogenesis and tissue maintenance, there is also
an essential need to ensure a proper balance between self-renewal and
differentiation, since a failure in either task will lead to organ
malformation and tissue malfunction. How this is accomplished at the
molecular and cellular level, however, remains poorly understood in
mammals. Conceptually, stem cells can simultaneously self-renew and
differentiate by dividing asymmetrically to produce one daughter cell
that remains as a stem cell and another that differentiates. Stem
cells, however, may also need to divide symmetrically to produce two
stem cells, which can quickly expand their population when responding
to a tissue injury, or to generate two differentiated cells, when large
numbers of stem cells are no longer necessary towards the end of
organogenesis and tissue repair. In other words, understanding the
division patterns of stem cells – particularly how they are regulated
under normal and pathological conditions – may facilitate a key goal of
stem-cell research, which is to repair or replace damaged tissues by
introducing exogenous stem cells or expanding endogenous populations. &lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;Asymmetric
cell division, a process by which a cell divides to produce two
different daughter cells, is widely used by invertebrates to generate
cellular diversity during development. In &lt;em&gt;Drosophila,&lt;/em&gt; the
Numb protein enables the two daughter cells to adopt different fates
after such divisions by segregating primarily to one daughter cell. To
examine the importance of asymmetric cell division in mammalian
development, we identified two mouse &lt;em&gt;numb&lt;/em&gt; genes, &lt;em&gt;m-numb (Numb)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;numblike (Numbl &lt;/em&gt;or&lt;em&gt; nbl)&lt;/em&gt;.
We postulated that mammalian neural progenitor cells, which behave like
stem cells during neurogenesis, balance self-renewal and
differentiation by segregating Numb proteins asymmetrically to produce
a daughter progenitor cell and a neuron. Through a series of loss- and
gain-of-function studies in mice, we show that &lt;em&gt;Numb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Numbl&lt;/em&gt;
are redundant but essential for embryogenesis and that asymmetric Numb
segregation and, therefore, asymmetric cell division are indeed
essential for neural progenitor cells to balance the competing needs of
self-renewal and differentiation during neurogenesis. Our studies
further reveal a novel cellular mechanism that uses Golgi fragmentation
and reconstitution, through changes in the subcellular distribution of
an essential Numb partner, the ACBD3 protein, to coordinate cell-cycle
progression and cell-fate specification during an asymmetric cell
division. &lt;/p&gt;

an essential Numb partner, the ACBD3 protein, to coordinate cell-cycle
progression and cell-fate specification during an asymmetric cell
division. &lt;/p&gt;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;strong&gt;(1) Probing the behavior of stem cells by changing their patterns of division&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have generated a set of unique mouse strains in which the division
patterns of stem cells in various tissues can be differentially
manipulated. We will use these mice to examine how stem cells behave in
their microenvironment (niche) under normal and pathological conditions
in the nervous system and other tissues. By forcing stem cells to
deviate from their normal patterns of division, we intend to identify
key regulators of stem cells using molecular and genetic tools. 
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) Examining how cell fates are assigned to maintain tissue homeostasis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;To maintain tissue homeostasis, stem cells have to generate
differentiated cells of specific types, in correct numbers and at
precise times. As a first step to understand how this is accomplished,
we will combine studies using mice and Drosophila to
elucidate the signaling pathway that enables Numb and ACBD3 proteins to
specify distinct daughter cell fates during an asymmetric division. We
will also examine whether the process of Golgi fragmentation and
reconstitution is a general mechanism for stem cells to coordinate
cellular signaling and cell-cycle progression. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Using embryonic stem (ES) cells to probe human developmental mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;We
intend to examine whether the findings from our mouse studies are
applicable to humans by determining whether Numb-mediated asymmetric
cell divisions, as well as the signaling pathways that regulate
stem-cell behavior, are used by human ES cells when they are induced to
undergo neurogenesis in culture.</ins>

										<li>There are 3 major areas of research in my lab: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulation of arterial development and branching morphogenesis&lt;/strong&gt;   The purpose of these studies is to elucidate molecular pathways leading to arterial specification of the endothelium and formation of arterial vasculature.  We have recently demonstrated that  knockout of synectin, a PDZ protein involved in endosomal trafficking of a number of TK receptor complexes leads to selective reduction in arterial morphogenesis and vascular branching (Chittenden et al Dev Cell, 2006). We have now demonstrated that synectin controls retrograde trafficking of VEGF-R2 containing endosomes via its binding to myosin-VI.  Interestingly, myosin-VI knockout in mice or knockdown in zebrafish leads to the same arteriopenic phenotype.  This abnormal receptor trafficking results in impaired activation of one of VEGF-R2 signaling pathways that appears to be crucial for arterial specification.   Rescue of this aspect of VEGF signaling fully restores arterial morphogenesis not only in synectin null or myosin-VI null mice but in other models of poor arterial development. Thus, this may be the critical pathways specifying arterial formation. Funding: NHLBI (2007-2012)   
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulation of vascular maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;. It has not been realized until recently that maintenance of vascular integrity is an active process requiring an ongoing signaling. We have been able to demonstrate that suppression of basal FGF signaling in endothelial cells results in loss of cell-cell contacts and loss of endothelium from the vascular wall (Murakami et al. JCI 2008). The molecular events involved include FGF regulation of VE-cadherin phosphorylation and suppression of local Src activation. Current efforts are focused on characterization of the FGF signaling-VE-cadherin link and elucidation of other pathways regulating VE-cadherin maintenance t the plasma cell membrane Funding: NHLBI (2008-2013).   
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syndecan-4 signaling&lt;/strong&gt;. Over the years my lab has demonstrated that syndecan-4 plays a critical role in regulation of FGF signaling (Horowitz, JCB ’02 and many others) and that this involves regulation of its trafficking to the plasma membrane rafts and endocytosis among other events (Tkachenko JBC ’02, JCS ’04, Circ Res ’06). Recently we discovered that in addition to its role in FGF signaling syndecan-4 controls formation of mTOR complex 2 and activation of  the Akt pathway (Partovian et a l Mol Cell ’08). Among many interesting phenotypes in syndecan-4 null is mice is arterial hypertension (lack of Akt activation leads to suppressed NO production) and defective tumor but not ischemic angiogenesis.  We are currently examining molecular events involved in syndecan-4 dependent regulation of mTORC2 formation that apparently include activation of RhoG via a novel mechanism involving sequestration of Rho-GDI (JCB, &#39;09) Funding: NHLBI (2008-2013) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
In addition, other emerging projects in the lab include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of Raf1 and MAPK signaling in regulation of arterial specification:&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We find that PI3K has the ability to inhibit MAPK signaling by phosphorylating Raf1 and that activation of RAf1 leads to profound stimulation of arterial growth and arterial specification. The molecular details of this pathways are being examined in a variety of transgenic mice models   
&lt;li&gt;Activation of arteriogenesis in arteriogenesis-resistant states: abnormal VEGF and other angiogenic growth factor signaling may be at the core of many events associated with advanced atherosclerosis, diabetes and other angiogenic signaling-resistant states. We are testing the concept that activation of arteriogenic signaling downstream of VEGF-R2 may promore arteriogenesis and become an effective therapeutic approach. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular mechanisms of fibroblast growth factors (FGF)-dependent regulation of vascular integrity and arteriogenesis&lt;/strong&gt;.  These studies focus on molecular details of FGF-R signaling including receptor endocytosis and trafficking and on FGF-dependent maintenance of VE-cadherin presence in cell-cell junctions.  Supported by NIH R01 HL53793 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arterial branching morphogenesis&lt;/strong&gt;. These studies are focused on the role of synectin (GIPC), a PDZ-domain containing scaffold molecule regulation of arteriogenesis and arterial branching in development and in adult tissues.  Specific problems examined include molecular mechanism of synectin-dependent regulation of VEGF signaling and cell type-specificity of effect. The latter involves generation and analysis of tissue-specific synectin knockouts and synectin null ES cells. Supported by R01 HL84619 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syndecan signaling in endothelial cells&lt;/strong&gt;. The project focuses on syndecan-4 signaling, a long standing interest in the lab. Two principle pathways being examined are the regulation of mTOR complex 2 assembly and Akt activation and Rac1 activation and cell motility.  Supported by R01 HL53793 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of angiogenic inhibitors in the development of pulmonary hypertension.&lt;/strong&gt;  In this collaborative project with Dr Fred Wigley’s laboratory at Johns Hopkins we are examining the. Prevalence of circulating angiogenic inhibitors in patients with scleroderma and their effect on the natural history of disease. Supported by NIH SCCOR P50 HL084946 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modulation of arteriogenic and metabolic environment in ischemia&lt;/strong&gt;. The goal of this multi-laboratory collaborative project si to examine therapeutic approaches to preservation of tissue function by modulation of its metabolic state and arterial blood supply. Collaborating laboratories include Peter Carmeliet (European Coordinator, Vesalius Research Center, University of Leuven, Belgium), Holger Gerhardt (Cancer Research UK, London, UK), Luisa Iruela-Arispe (UCLA), Frank Giordano (Yale University) and A.

										<li>The primary focus of our laboratory is understand the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney and liver diseases (ADPKD, ADPLD, ARPKD). These diseases are the most prominent among a larger group of pleiotropic human genetic diseases which share fibrocystic deterioration of the kidney and liver as a key phenotypic feature and whose pathogenesis is related to the functioning of the primary cilium and basal body complex. Study of these diseases have uncovered the central role of cilia in novel signaling pathways and in establishing and maintaining three dimensional tissue organization. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of polycystic diseases will not only shed light on diseases for which there are no therapies currently but will also uncover general principles of the functioning of cilia in human biology.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have taken a longitudinal approach to the pathogenesis of PKD beginning with discovery of human disease genes for dominant PKD (PKD2), recessive PKD (PKHD1) and two genes for isolated dominant polycystic liver disease (PRKCSH, SEC63). Our lab now seeks to define the cellular pathways in which the PKD-gene products function and to translate these findings to treatment for PKD. A central principle of our current approach is need to address disease processes affecting three dimensional tissue organization and polarity using in vivo vertebrate models. To this end, we have developed a series of conditional and inducible mouse models of the relevant human disease genes and combined them with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic lines modified by recombineering to define the mechanisms of PKD in vivo. Specific projects include dissection of the molecular pathways of trafficking of PKD1 and PKD2,  to cilia, the inter-relationship of cilial function with the ER proteins PRKCSH and SEC63, the regulation of the PKD2 Ca2+ channel, the role of Ca2+ signaling in PKD and the intersection of tissue polarity (also called planar cell polarity) with PKD pathways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We continue to keep in focus the need to develop principles for therapy in PKD that are based on basic science discoveries and to this end have focused on defining the cellular features of cyst cells (e.g., proliferation, cystoskeletal features, intercellular adhesion properties, etc.) as means of defining targets for therapy.

My main research project at this time is the
characterization of an organic solute transporter, Osta-Ostb, which is
up-regulated during cholestasis. 
This transporter is expressed highly in the intestine, kidney, and
(human) liver and is essential for homeostatic control of bile acid
biosynthesis.  I have characterized
its heterodimeric nature and have shown in a genetically deficient mouse that
during obstructive cholestasis its absence may play a protective role by
augmenting renal clearance of bile acids.

										<li>Data show that
psychological factors play an important role in acute coronary syndromes. We
and others, have found mentally demanding tasks such as mental arithmetic to
provoke ischemia in approximately 50% of patients with ischemic heart disease.
We have also found a specific psychological profile, characterized by emotional
reactivity, and easily aroused anger and hostility, to be associated with this
“mental stress ischemia”; conversely, we have not found an association between
this profile and exercise ischemia. Follow up of these mental stress positive
patients reveal a significantly poorer 1-2 year prognosis. Hence, mental stress
ischemia may be a distinct phenomenon with unique risk factors and prognosis.
The mechanisms of mental stress ischemia are, however, not well understood.
Critical questions remain regarding the ways by which mental and psychological
factors contribute to coronary syndromes. We believe that psychological,
neurobiological and coronary vasomotor processes are key factors, expanding
upon our pilot work, conducted in the context of our current funding. We are
examining the functional CNS correlates of mental stress ischemia; these CNS correlates
will be defined by positron emission tomography (PET) conducted while patients
perform an arithmetic task that we have found to reliably provoke ischemia in
half of those we have studied. This approach will illuminate CNS processes that
may be serving to transduce mental stress susceptibility into risk for acute
coronary events. Specific issues concerning gender interaction and relationship
to psychological profiles/coping styles are currently being explored.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

The overarching research theme of
our research is the elucidation of those mechanisms, which transduce cognitive
stress as a provocation of myocardial ischemia. Specifically, we are interested
in the neurobiology and coronary flow dynamics that results from mentally
stressful tasks. Our work utilizes simultaneous
measurements of brain activation and myocardial function/coronary flow with
PET imaging, echocardiography and pulse arterial tonometry during laboratory
mental stress. We are developing conceptual constructs based upon our previous
work, which support a model that suggests certain regional and global brain
activation maps
are associated with coronary flow responses specific to psychosocial stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our goal for the next academic year
is to describe the pathophysiologic mechanisms of mental stress induced
myocardial ischemia that differs from those that are a result of exercise. We
have the largest series of subjects to date (n=138) undergoing simultaneous
imaging with PET during Mental Stress and then again with dobutamine as a
surrogate for exercise in a population of
CAD subjects. Our results thus far support our hypothesis of regional
activation in the brain that promote parasympathetic withdrawal, increase
in sympathetic tone and decrease LV flow/ function that is not observed in the
dobutamine group (exercise surrogate) is thus far confirmed.  A manuscript based on these results is
in preparation. We have studies that show a gender interaction that has just been
analyzed and these data will be prepared and submitted afterwards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An individual’s biological substrate
interacts within this neurobehavioral context thru genetic, endocrine, immune
and neural processes. Many of these processes are shape by inflammatory responses. Our
previous published reports reinforced the principle that inflammatory processes
may also be associated with other dimensions of CAD expression. In this past
year we have expanded our constructs regarding the role of other vascular
factors, which may be operative during Mental Stress Ischemia. Specifically
our recent data suggests an up regulation of ET-1 among CAD patients who are
subjected to a standardized Anger recall paradigm. We have also described these
findings in the context of the parasympathetic inflammatory response, which
predicts such increases in response to w withdrawal of parasympathetic tone, a
cardinal feature of Mental Stress Induced Myocardial Ischemia. We have observed
an inverse relationship of TNF-alpha and parasympathetic withdrawal in subjects
who become ischemic and have specific regional brain activation
coincident with this process. Finally, we have developed and

										<li>A deep commitment to academic medicine has fundamentally influenced my research interests, from years of basic molecular neuroscience research to becoming a double-boarded physician in Adult Neurology and Clinical Genetics with a continuing involvement in basic and translational research. My early studies focused on how conserved genetic programs can change in mature neurons in response to specific, transmitter-receptor mediated signals. The realization, that dynamic alteration of genetic programs may also play a fundamental role in pathological processes, led to my focus on how various layers of genomic architecture are influencing a phenotype in health and disease.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Exploitation of rare genetic disorders with Mendelian trait may provide novel insights into mechanisms of common disorders and complex biological processes, such as dementia, diabetes or aging, and recognized disease pathways can offer strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.   &lt;br&gt;   Among the simple Mendelian disorders of humans, Werner syndrome most closely resembles an acceleration of normal aging. In prior studies I demonstrated that WRN protein directly interacts with the DNA replication machinery. To define better cellular events that are specifically vulnerable to WRN deficiency, I used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence the expression of Wrn gene and other RecQ helicases, linked to different clinical phenotypes, in primary human fibroblasts. The series of investigations strongly suggest that defects in DNA repair of specific lesions produced by oxidative damage in slowly dividing or non-dividing cells account for those unique aspects of Werner syndrome that mimic normal aging. We also propose that over time these DNA lesions would also accumulate in stem/precursor cells impairing their replicative capacity, thereby contributing to the complex aging phenotype. Our observations attest to the concept that in metazoan models of aging most pathology occurs in organs made up of slowly dividing or non-dividing cells and that impaired DNA repair and genomic instability, driven by oxidative damage, may underlie normal human aging. These studies further fostered some of the current projects to understand the role of oxygen environment on stem cell pluripotency, stem cell aging and neural lineage specification.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Genetic mapping, identifying contributing gene mutations and variants, is only an initial step toward biological understanding of rare or common diseases. Creation of disease models, both in human cell culture and animals, is crucial. Human embryonic stem (hES) cells offer an unprecedented access to the earliest stage of development and modeling cell fate and function. In particular, molecular changes that arise during neuronal differentiation and fate specification can be elucidated that may offer key understanding of normal and abnormal human neural development and disease processes.  &lt;br&gt;   We are using a multifaceted approach with investigators of the Yale Stem Cell Center, integrating genomic, proteomic, and genetic experiments to elucidate the molecular events that control neural cell differentiation using hES cells as model system. We have analyzed global transcriptome changes that occur during the early differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into the neural lineage. Next generation, state-of-the-art sequencing analysis revealed a remarkable complexity in gene transcription and splicing dynamics during neural cell differentiation with a wealth of previously unannotated novel transcripts and spliced isoforms specific for each stage of differentiation. My current efforts are focused on a novel type of unbiased, genome-wide functional screen to identify genetic mechanisms that control the steps of the neural differentiation in hES cells. These studies and the platform would offer targets for more downstream goals, including mechanistic investigations or drug discovery.    &lt;br&gt;Further, in a collaborative project within Yale, we investigate the effect of hypoxia in neural stem cell function to identify key genes and their networks that enable neuronal stem cells to repair the injured brain in mouse model of perinatal hypoxia and elucidate the role of these genes for human neuronal stem cell function. The project may provide clues how to promote neuronal stem cell regenerative potential in traumatic, vascular and degenerative disorders of the human brain.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. To understand the genetic and molecular underpinnings of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, we capitalize on the recent technical development of reprogramming adult, differentiated somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells. These &lt;em&gt;induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells&lt;/em&gt; can be derived with a specific genetic and disease background and can differentiate into essentially any cell types of the body. Thus, by using patient-specific cells one may gain knowledge of key molecular players and abnormalities of neural fate determination and function to understand monogenic or complex developmental and degenerative brain disorders. This would not be otherwise possible to do in living CNS.  &lt;br&gt;   With other Yale investigators with interest in neurogenetics, we have recently launched the Program in Neurodevelopment and Regeneration and began to generate iPS cell lines derived directly from patients with various neurodevelopmental disorders with notable genetic component, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We are particularly interested to understand if macrocephaly, a well replicated phenotype in ASD, may be related to intrinsic alterations neuronal stem cell properties governing cell proliferation and/or neural and glial differentiation and how these processes align with the patient-specific genomic architecture.

										<li>										A deep commitment to academic medicine has fundamentally influenced my research interests, from years of basic molecular neuroscience research to becoming a double-boarded physician in Adult Neurology and Clinical Genetics with a continuing involvement in basic and translational research. My early studies focused on how conserved genetic programs can change in mature neurons in response to specific, transmitter-receptor mediated signals. The realization, that dynamic alteration of genetic programs may also play a fundamental role in pathological processes, led to my focus on how various layers of genomic architecture are influencing a phenotype in health and disease.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Exploitation of rare genetic disorders with Mendelian trait may provide novel insights into mechanisms of common disorders and complex biological processes, such as dementia, diabetes or aging, and recognized disease pathways can offer strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.   &lt;br&gt;   Among the simple Mendelian disorders of humans, Werner syndrome most closely resembles an acceleration of normal aging. In prior studies I demonstrated that WRN protein directly interacts with the DNA replication machinery. To define better cellular events that are specifically vulnerable to WRN deficiency, I used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence the expression of Wrn gene and other RecQ helicases, linked to different clinical phenotypes, in primary human fibroblasts. The series of investigations strongly suggest that defects in DNA repair of specific lesions produced by oxidative damage in slowly dividing or non-dividing cells account for those unique aspects of Werner syndrome that mimic normal aging. We also propose that over time these DNA lesions would also accumulate in stem/precursor cells impairing their replicative capacity, thereby contributing to the complex aging phenotype. Our observations attest to the concept that in metazoan models of aging most pathology occurs in organs made up of slowly dividing or non-dividing cells and that impaired DNA repair and genomic instability, driven by oxidative damage, may underlie normal human aging. These studies further fostered some of the current projects to understand the role of oxygen environment on stem cell pluripotency, stem cell aging and neural lineage specification.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Genetic mapping, identifying contributing gene mutations and variants, is only an initial step toward biological understanding of rare or common diseases. Creation of disease models, both in human cell culture and animals, is crucial. Human embryonic stem (hES) cells offer an unprecedented access to the earliest stage of development and modeling cell fate and function. In particular, molecular changes that arise during neuronal differentiation and fate specification can be elucidated that may offer key understanding of normal and abnormal human neural development and disease processes.  &lt;br&gt;   We are using a multifaceted approach with investigators of the Yale Stem Cell Center, integrating genomic, proteomic, and genetic experiments to elucidate the molecular events that control neural cell differentiation using hES cells as model system. We have analyzed global transcriptome changes that occur during the early differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into the neural lineage. Next generation, state-of-the-art sequencing analysis revealed a remarkable complexity in gene transcription and splicing dynamics during neural cell differentiation with a wealth of previously unannotated novel transcripts and spliced isoforms specific for each stage of differentiation. My current efforts are focused on a novel type of unbiased, genome-wide functional screen to identify genetic mechanisms that control the steps of the neural differentiation in hES cells. These studies and the platform would offer targets for more downstream goals, including mechanistic investigations or drug discovery.    &lt;br&gt;Further, in a collaborative project within Yale, we investigate the effect of hypoxia in neural stem cell function to identify key genes and their networks that enable neuronal stem cells to repair the injured brain in mouse model of perinatal hypoxia and elucidate the role of these genes for human neuronal stem cell function. The project may provide clues how to promote neuronal stem cell regenerative potential in traumatic, vascular and degenerative disorders of the human brain.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. To understand the genetic and molecular underpinnings of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, we capitalize on the recent technical development of reprogramming adult, differentiated somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells. These &lt;em&gt;induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells&lt;/em&gt; can be derived with a specific genetic and disease background and can differentiate into essentially any cell types of the body. Thus, by using patient-specific cells one may gain knowledge of key molecular players and abnormalities of neural fate determination and function to understand monogenic or complex developmental and degenerative brain disorders. This would not be otherwise possible to do in living CNS.  &lt;br&gt;   With other Yale investigators with interest in neurogenetics, we have recently launched the Program in Neurodevelopment and Regeneration and began to generate iPS cell lines derived directly from patients with various neurodevelopmental disorders with notable genetic component, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We are particularly interested to understand if macrocephaly, a well replicated phenotype in ASD, may be related to intrinsic alterations neuronal stem cell properties governing cell proliferation and/or neural and glial differentiation and how these processes align with the patient-specific genomic architecture. Advanced technologies are used to reprogram skin cells, obtain data on patient-specific DNA variations and integrate with quantitative gene expression information and correlative epigenetic regulatory marks along with phenotypic analysis of neural differentiation.  These projects may provide an exceptional chance to understand the genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying this complex disorder and also to correlate with the clinical phenotype. As a model in general, iPS cells provide an invaluable resource for in vitro disease modeling, pharmaceutical screening (drugs/small molecules) and potential for cell-replacement therapy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.

										<li>The Vaccarino laboratory has elucidated crucial mechanisms that regulate neural stem cell self-renewal, survival and differentiation. The lab has been redefining the roles of astroglial cells—extremely diverse cellular elements that evolve from a primary role of neural progenitors during embryonic development, to essential partners in neuronal migration, maturation, axon guidance. These cells have essential metabolic function in the adult brain and retain ability to divide and act as precursors.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the 1990’s Vaccarino and colleagues reported that an extracellular protein called Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) increases the number of progenitors for excitatory cortical neurons in vitro (Vaccarino et al., 1995) and that a single microinjection of FGF2 into the cerebral ventricles of rat embryos doubled the number of excitatory neurons generated during cortical development (Vaccarino et al., 1999). This was the first evidence that a single factor can elicit a permanent increase in cerebral cortical size and neuron number in a mammalian species. Conversely, using knockout mice, Vaccarino and colleagues demonstrated that the Fgf2 gene product is essential for the generation of a normal number of excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex by increasing cell proliferation in the cortical neuroepithelium (Vaccarino et al., 1999; Raballo et al., 2000; Korada et al., 2002). Subsequent work of demonstrated that FGF receptors are essential for normal telencephalic development. The disruption of the Fgfr1 gene is sufficient to thwart cell proliferation within the hippocampal primordium, causing lifelong hippocampal atrophy (Ohkubo et al., 2004). In contrast, the antagonism of all FGF receptors is required to disrupt cortical development. Driving a dominant negative Fgfr1 to the cortical primordium resulted in decreased generation and lower numbers of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, which form the primary scaffold of the cortex, and cortical atrophy (Shin et al., 2004). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the evolution of this research, Vaccarino and her colleagues discovered that FGF receptors play an indirect but crucial role in the development of inhibitory neurons. A lower number of inhibitory neurons containing parvalbumin was observed in the adult cerebral cortex of both Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 null mutant mice (Muller Smith et al., 2008). Recent data suggest that the GABA neuron defect is attributable to their deficient maturation or survival during early postnatal development. Further, the stereotypic locomotor hyperactivity exhibited by FGF receptor mutant mice was inversely proportional to the number of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons in their cerebral cortex (Muller Smith et al., 2008). Interestingly, parallel work in postmortem human brains performed by the same lab showed that the same parvalbumin inhibitory neurons are decreased in number within the caudate nucleus of patients with Tourette syndrome (Kalanithi et al., 2005). It is also known that cortical parvalbumin neurons are decreased in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The lab is now focused on elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control parvalbumin neuron differentiation and survival throughout early postnatal development. These processes may require paracrine astroglia-neuron signaling, which requires FGF receptors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another idea that has been put forward by the Vaccarino laboratory is that cortical neurogenesis does not abruptly stop at birth but that the immature brain has the capacity to produce new cortical neurons, a process that is enhanced by injury. The lab has observed that after neonatal hypoxia, the excitatory neuron losses spontaneously recover in the cerebral cortex (Fagel et al., 2006, and Fagel et al., 2009). During this phase there is a prominent increase in cell proliferation and neurogenesis, along with an increase in expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 in the forebrain germinal zones (Ganat et al, 2002). The proliferation, neurogenesis and ensuing neuronal recovery are both nearly absent in Fgfr1 conditional null mutant mice.  This represents the first evidence that excitatory neurons can recover after a postnatal insult and that FGFR1 in astroglial cells is centrally involved in this process (Fagel et al, 2009). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To further study the role of glial stem/progenitor cells in regenerative processes, the lab has generated the GFAP-CreERT2 transgenic line, in which the Cre recombinase can be transiently induced by a drug injection in astroglial cells (Ganat et al, 2006). This mouse model allows investigators to identify and follow astroglial cells and their progeny. These cells can be also genetically altered in a temporally controlled manner.  In recognition of this work, the laboratory was recently awarded a grant from the State of Connecticut to study the gene expression and fate potential of astroglial cells after hypoxic insult. &lt;br&gt;Studies are underway to reveal the mechanisms and pathways that are involved in brain adaptation and self-repair after this insult. Parallel experiments will elucidate astroglia-specific transcripts that allow these cells to undergo dramatic fate transition from quiescent to reactive/proliferative, and from glial to neuron.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Vaccarino research has contributed key insights into the processes that regulate the number and differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in both prenatal and postnatal development. They have proposed that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex and connected regions is regulated by developmental genes (i.e., Fgf) as well as by environmental factors (i.e., hypoxia) acting at crucial stages in development. Disruption of this delicate balance produces predictable alterations in psychomotor behavior in our animal models. These animal models mimic aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., hyperactivity, impulsivity, poor learning) and can be used to study ways to repair or reverse these deficits. The cerebral cortex and connected regions engage patterns of goal-directed behavior that are assembled during infancy. Concomitantly, the cortex represses impulsive, unwanted behaviors. Poor organization and control of cognitive and motor processes due to disrupted cortical development may be shared in various ways by schizophrenia, autism, ADHD and Tourette’s Syndrome.

Proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) during prenatal and postnatal stages of cerebral development and in response to injury&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. Role of Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) in NSC differentiation. &lt;/strong&gt;Using gain or loss of function for FGFs and their receptors in NSC, we have shown that prenatal loss of FGF/FGFRs causes altered brain size and imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory neuron types, with long-term repercussions in the animal’s behavior. In addition, FGFs are required postnatally for brain regeneration and recovery after perinatal hypoxic injury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. Diversity and function of astroglia.&lt;/strong&gt;  Astroglial cells comprise a diversity of cellular phenotypes, from radial glial progenitors in prenatal development to astrocytes in adult brains. These cells undergo plastic changes during development and aging; postnatal NSCs are modified astroglial cells. We are analyzing the transcriptome of astroglial cells in normal development and after hypoxia or environmental perturbations. The function of specific gene products in astroglia is investigated by inducible cre recombination, both at the cellular and organism level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Cellular alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. Mouse models. &lt;/strong&gt;The effects of perinatal hypoxia on brain development. We study an animal model of perinatal hypoxia, which models cognitive handicap common in premature children. We have shown that mice raised in hypoxic conditions have a persistent deficit in inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex. We are investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate brain injury and brain repair, focusing on the role of astroglial cells in orchestrating recovery.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. Postmortem analyses of the human brain.&lt;/strong&gt; An excitatory/inhibitory neuronal imbalance in specific forebrain systems due to disparate etiologies can be the common pathogenesis of childhood neuropsychiatric disorders such as Tourette’s syndrome and autism.  For example, we have shown that individuals with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) have losses of Parvalbumin and cholinergic interneurons in specific regions of the striatum. The hypothesis is that altered postnatal maturation/survival of subsets of inhibitory neurons in cortico-basal ganglia circuits causes specific alterations in synchronous neuronal firing that may model disorders of the TS spectrum. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)&lt;/strong&gt;.  To recapitulate the dynamics of human neuronal development in an in vitro system, we will generate induced pluripotent cells (iPSC) by “reprogramming” somatic cells into a pluripotent state. These cells can be induced to differentiate into neural progenitors and then into forebrain neurons and glia. Using somatic cells from patients with neuropsychiatric disorders will allow us to investigate disease and patient-specific features of the neural differentiation process. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Program in Neurodevelopment and Regeneration&lt;/em&gt; involves faculty from Child Study Center, Genetics, Neurobiology, Psychiatry, and Pediatrics.The objectives of this new interdepartmental program are to use induced pluripotent cells (iPSC) as a tool to understand neuronal development in individuals with specific neuropsychiatric disorders.  &lt;br&gt;Neuronal development will be recapitulated in vitro by differentiating neuronal progenitors of various CNS lineages from iPSC lines.  This will allow different investigators participating in this program to perform cellular, molecular, genetic, epigenetic and functional studies of these cell lines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scientific goals &lt;/strong&gt;of the Program are: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. A detailed cellular and functional study of the particular features of neurons and glia derived from patient-specific iPSC lines to understand the biological mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Correlate cellular and functional events in neural development with underlying changes in genomic sequence, epigenomic imprinting and regulation of gene expression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</ins>

										<li>Limbs have played a crucial role in animal evolution. The evolution of wings is recognized as the key innovation
behind the evolutionary success of the insects, while the adaptive evolution of
vertebrates to aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial environments involved the
acquisition and modification of their limbs.  My interests in the establishment, patterning and
development of limbs have led me to work in both arthropods and chordates. 

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Graduate
research&lt;/em&gt;: As a
graduate student with Sean Carroll at the University
of Wisconsin, Madison, I investigated the regulatory networks governed
by the Homeotic (Hox) genes that control the differentiation of serially
homologous structures within an individual species and the divergence of
homologs between species. I utilized the insect wing (in the fruitfly Drosophila
melanogaster and
the butterfly Precis coenia) as a model system to gain a fundamental
understanding of how the Hox class of transcription factors controlled the
placement and morphology of insect flight appendages and how this regulation
might have changed over the course of evolution. We initially set out to better
define the role of Hox genes in regulating wing number.  I discovered that no Hox genes were
required to promote wing development, in Drosophila contrasting with previous notions,
but instead that Hox genes in wingless segments repress wing development.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I further examined Hox gene expression
in a primitive wingless insect and discovered that the domains of Ultrabithorax
(Ubx) and Abdominal-A (Abd-A) were largely similar to those in Drosophila. As wing-like protrusions first
appear on all segments in fossil insects, this suggests that Hox genes acquired
their wing-repressive role over the course of insect wing evolution.  I went on to show that in addition to
its wing-repressive ability in the abdomen, Ubx regulates the identity of the D.
melanogaster
hindwing (haltere) by acting independently on selected subsets of genes
downstream of the global wing organizing signals and at multiple levels of the
wing developmental patterning hierarchy. Further, using a unique strain of P.
coenia, which
displayed homeotic transformations on their hindwings, I showed that Ubx
regulates a different set of target genes in butterflies compared to fruit
flies.  Together, these studies
have led to a deeper understanding of how the Hox genes control and diversify
body plans and of their role in the evolution of body parts and patterns. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; Postdoctoral
research&lt;/em&gt;: As a
postdoctoral fellow, I examined the genetic and molecular mechanisms that
regulate patterning and morphogenesis of the mammalian limb. I worked with Drs.
Lee Niswander and Kathryn Anderson at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
Part of my work focused on a gene, Lrp4 that is required for limb patterning. I
have studied how Lrp4 acts in the limb in conjunction with other developmental
pathways to specify the AER and have explored how this gene ties into known
developmental genetic pathways.  In
the course of these studies, I found that Lrp4 is required for a variety of
different developmental processes, including formation of the neuromuscular
junction. In parallel studies, I also studied how homologous limbs diverge in
different mammalian lineages by comparing the mechanisms of limb patterning
between the mouse and the bat. 

 

Lrp4 is a critical factor
for limb patterning and development

I
identified Lrp4 as a gene mutated in 2 mouse lines derived from a forward
genetics screen. Lrp4 is required at the early limb bud stage (E9.5), a time
when the AER is first formed.  In
the absence of Lrp4 function, the AER cells fail to compact at the
dorsal-ventral interface of the limb; the result is a broadened AER at the
distal edge of the limb with cells that lack their characteristic columnar
shape.  As the AER is a crucial organizer
of limb outgrowth, disruptions in its morphogenesis can explain most of the
subsequent defects in limb development in Lrp4 mutants. Based on homology, Lrp4
is most closely related to Lrp5 and Lrp6, which are required for canonical Wnt
signaling, however I tested the hypothesis that Lrp4 affects Wnt signaling and
concluded that this is not the case in the early limb. Lrp4 is expressed in a
complex pattern during development, including the teeth, kidneys, mammary buds
and vibrissae, and that mutants show defects in each of the tissues where the
gene is expressed.  

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Divergence of vertebrate
limb morphology: how the bat got its wings

I have
continued my interest in the morphological diversification of homologous
structures by studying the bat wing. The evolution of bat wing membranes and
powered flight must have depended on mechanisms to retain and elaborate
interdigit tissue. I identified a novel mechanism
utilized in the bat wing to prevent apoptosis and interdigital regression
involving a unique domain of Fgf8 expression in bat forelimb interdigits. In
addition, high expression levels of the potent Bmp inhibitor Gremlin is found
in bat forelimb interdigits but not in the un-webbed hindlimbs. By growing bat
limbs in culture and experimentally manipulating these signals, I found that
the combined action of increased Bmp and decreased Fgf signaling results in
extensive forelimb interdigital apoptosis. Thus it appears that in the bat
wing, inhibition of Bmp and activation of Fgf signaling cooperate to prevent
interdigital cell death.  These
data indicate that although there is not a conserved mechanism for maintaining
interdigit tissue across amniotes. In the bat, the expression in the bat
forelimb interdigits of Gremlin and Fgf8 suggests that these key molecular
changes underlie the evolution of the bat wing membrane.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ongoing
and future research&lt;/em&gt;:  

Characterization of
additional genes affecting limb morphology

From a
subsequent round of mutagenesis screening in Dr. Anderson’s lab, I identified 3
additional mutant lines that display abnormal limb patterning and
morphogenesis, as well as defects in other organs.  We are continuing to work on these lines to identify the
affected gene and determine the roles of these genes in limb and organ
development.

 

Lrp4 and Shd, two genes that control formation
of the AER

The AER
plays a pivotal role in limb development through its signaling interactions
with limb bud mesenchyme. Despite recent advances in defining some of the major
genes necessary to form a limb, our understanding of how the AER is established
and refined through the migration and compaction of Fgf8-expressing cells is
not understood.  I am currently
working with two mutant lines, Lrp4 and a new mutant line, shorthand (shd), that show dorsal-ventral expansion
of the AER during early limb development to examine the early steps of AER
morphogenesis and AER maintenance.

 

While the
role of Lrp4 in limb development is unresolved, the early expansion of the AER
suggests that Lrp4 is critical for determining the number of cells adopting an
AER fate and also for setting the boundaries of the AER. My in vivo studies demonstrate expansion of
both Fgf and Bmp signaling in the early Lrp4 mutant limbs.  As both of these signaling pathways
contribute to AER formation and Fgf8 expression in the early limb, the
expansion of either could underlie the broadening of the AER in Lrp4 mutants.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our preliminary experiments in Xenopus (in collaboration with Dr. Xi He’s
laboratory) do not corroborate this. 
Dorsal injection of Lrp4 mRNA does not inhibit Wnt-mediated dorsal axis
specification and co-injection of Lrp4 and Wnt8 did not inhibit activation of
the Wnt-target Xnr3.  Thus, further
study is required to determine the signaling pathway(s) affected by Lrp4.

 

The
expanded AER phenotype in line shd occurs slightly later than Lrp4 mutants, suggesting that
maintenance of the normal boundaries of the AER is disrupted in shd mutants.  Exploration of this phenotype will shed light on the factors
required for maintenance of a discreet border between AER and limb ectoderm.
Line shd has
been mapped to a gene-dense genomic interval and should be cloned shortly. How
the early signaling pathways, including Bmps and Wnts converge on Fgf8 in the
early limb and what factors regulate the morphology of AER are not understood.
In my laboratory, I will use genetic interaction experiments between Lrp4, shd,
Wnt and Bmp pathway components and their inhibitors to define the role of these
genes in establishing normal number of cells in the AER, and setting its
borders and directing AER morphogenesis.   

 

We are
continuing to work with these mutants to better define how Lrp4 and shd
regulate the AER.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of
human relevance, one of the most common types of birth defects is
deformation of the limbs.  However, little is known about the
developmental, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying these
defects. Identification of the molecular mechanisms that pattern limbs
will lead to a better understanding of the possible causes of human
limb defects.

										<li>										Limbs have played a crucial role in animal evolution. The evolution of wings is recognized as the key innovation
behind the evolutionary success of the insects, while the adaptive evolution of
vertebrates to aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial environments involved the
acquisition and modification of their limbs.  My interests in the establishment, patterning and
development of limbs have led me to work in both arthropods and chordates. 

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Graduate
research&lt;/em&gt;: As a
graduate student with Sean Carroll at the University
of Wisconsin, Madison, I investigated the regulatory networks governed
by the Homeotic (Hox) genes that control the differentiation of serially
homologous structures within an individual species and the divergence of
homologs between species. I utilized the insect wing (in the fruitfly Drosophila
melanogaster and
the butterfly Precis coenia) as a model system to gain a fundamental
understanding of how the Hox class of transcription factors controlled the
placement and morphology of insect flight appendages and how this regulation
might have changed over the course of evolution. We initially set out to better
define the role of Hox genes in regulating wing number.  I discovered that no Hox genes were
required to promote wing development, in Drosophila contrasting with previous notions,
but instead that Hox genes in wingless segments repress wing development.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I further examined Hox gene expression
in a primitive wingless insect and discovered that the domains of Ultrabithorax
(Ubx) and Abdominal-A (Abd-A) were largely similar to those in Drosophila. As wing-like protrusions first
appear on all segments in fossil insects, this suggests that Hox genes acquired
their wing-repressive role over the course of insect wing evolution.  I went on to show that in addition to
its wing-repressive ability in the abdomen, Ubx regulates the identity of the D.
melanogaster
hindwing (haltere) by acting independently on selected subsets of genes
downstream of the global wing organizing signals and at multiple levels of the
wing developmental patterning hierarchy. Further, using a unique strain of P.
coenia, which
displayed homeotic transformations on their hindwings, I showed that Ubx
regulates a different set of target genes in butterflies compared to fruit
flies.  Together, these studies
have led to a deeper understanding of how the Hox genes control and diversify
body plans and of their role in the evolution of body parts and patterns. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; Postdoctoral
research&lt;/em&gt;: As a
postdoctoral fellow, I examined the genetic and molecular mechanisms that
regulate patterning and morphogenesis of the mammalian limb. I worked with Drs.
Lee Niswander and Kathryn Anderson at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
Part of my work focused on a gene, Lrp4 that is required for limb patterning. I
have studied how Lrp4 acts in the limb in conjunction with other developmental
pathways to specify the AER and have explored how this gene ties into known
developmental genetic pathways.  In
the course of these studies, I found that Lrp4 is required for a variety of
different developmental processes, including formation of the neuromuscular
junction. In parallel studies, I also studied how homologous limbs diverge in
different mammalian lineages by comparing the mechanisms of limb patterning
between the mouse and the bat. 

 

Lrp4 is a critical factor
for limb patterning and development

I
identified Lrp4 as a gene mutated in 2 mouse lines derived from a forward
genetics screen. Lrp4 is required at the early limb bud stage (E9.5), a time
when the AER is first formed.  In
the absence of Lrp4 function, the AER cells fail to compact at the
dorsal-ventral interface of the limb; the result is a broadened AER at the
distal edge of the limb with cells that lack their characteristic columnar
shape.  As the AER is a crucial organizer
of limb outgrowth, disruptions in its morphogenesis can explain most of the
subsequent defects in limb development in Lrp4 mutants. Based on homology, Lrp4
is most closely related to Lrp5 and Lrp6, which are required for canonical Wnt
signaling, however I tested the hypothesis that Lrp4 affects Wnt signaling and
concluded that this is not the case in the early limb. Lrp4 is expressed in a
complex pattern during development, including the teeth, kidneys, mammary buds
and vibrissae, and that mutants show defects in each of the tissues where the
gene is expressed.  

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Divergence of vertebrate
limb morphology: how the bat got its wings

I have
continued my interest in the morphological diversification of homologous
structures by studying the bat wing. The evolution of bat wing membranes and
powered flight must have depended on mechanisms to retain and elaborate
interdigit tissue. I identified a novel mechanism
utilized in the bat wing to prevent apoptosis and interdigital regression
involving a unique domain of Fgf8 expression in bat forelimb interdigits. In
addition, high expression levels of the potent Bmp inhibitor Gremlin is found
in bat forelimb interdigits but not in the un-webbed hindlimbs. By growing bat
limbs in culture and experimentally manipulating these signals, I found that
the combined action of increased Bmp and decreased Fgf signaling results in
extensive forelimb interdigital apoptosis. Thus it appears that in the bat
wing, inhibition of Bmp and activation of Fgf signaling cooperate to prevent
interdigital cell death.  These
data indicate that although there is not a conserved mechanism for maintaining
interdigit tissue across amniotes. In the bat, the expression in the bat
forelimb interdigits of Gremlin and Fgf8 suggests that these key molecular
changes underlie the evolution of the bat wing membrane.

will lead to a better understanding of the possible causes of human
limb defects.<ins class='diffins'>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To
broaden our insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying limb
formation and patterning we are studying novel mutants with limb
defects that were identified in a forward genetics screen in the mouse.
Two of these mutants, schlei and kerouac show preaxial polydactyly and affect anterior-posterior patterning.  In contrast, shorthand
displays brachydactyly, or shortening of the phalanges.  The genomic
regions linked to these mutants do not contain known limb patterning
genes, indicating that we have identified novel genes required for limb
development.  The characterization and cloning of the genes affected in
these mutants should provide a better understanding of
anterior-posterior and proximal-distal patterning during limb
development. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
   
   &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The
lab is also continuing to work on a pair of mutants that were
identified in two independent screens.  These lines both contain
mutations in the low density lipoprotein related 4 gene (Lrp4).  Lrp4
is essential for proper patterning along all three of the major axes
during limb development.  In addition, Lrp4 is required for
neuromuscular junction formation and normal development of ectodermal
organs such as mammary buds, teeth and vibrissae.  We are interested in
defining how Lrp4 regulates the development of these vastly different
organs and in determining which signaling pathways Lrp4 interacts
with.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
   
   We
feel that we’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg and that there are
many more genes required for limb development that remain to be
discovered.  We plan to continue screening to identify additional novel
genes that are required for normal limb development.  Together, these
studies will give depth to the current models of limb developmental
regulatory hierarchies and provide a basis for understanding human
birth defects, specifically those affecting the limb.&lt;/li&gt;

										<li>Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis and function of signal transduction pathways, with the emphasis on those initiated by seven-transmembrane receptors. These receptors can be divided into two groups: one couples to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins; and the other binds to ligands including hedgehog proteins and Wnt proteins. Currently, we are focusing on chemoattractant and Wnt-activated signaling.

Chemoattractants, including the superfamily of chemotactic cytokines, chemokines, play an important role in host defense by attracting and activating leukocytes at sites of injury and infection. However, their unchecked activities contribute to may inflammation-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, tumorigenesis, and various allergies. Work in my lab has made significant contributions to the understanding of signaling mechanisms and functions of a number of chemoattractant-activated pathways. These include pathways linked by PLC &#223;, PI3K?, PIXa/Pak/Cdc42, PTEN, P-Rex1, and Myo1f. We are continuing to use a combination of molecular and cell biological, biochemical, transgenic, functional genomic, and proteomic approaches to characterize novel chemoattractant signaling mechanisms and study their functions in cell migration and inflammation-related paradigms.

The Wnt family of secretory glycoproteins participates in a wide variety of developmental events including, control of cell growth, generation of cell polarity, and specification of cell fate. Wnt pathways have been also closely linked to tumorigenesis and bone formation. Most notable contributions from my is the discovery of the interaction between Wnt coreceptor LRP-5 and Axin, which provides the first connection from a Wnt receptor to a intracellular signaling component and the characterization of the role of Dkk2 in regulation of osteogenic differentiation. We are continuing to work on the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms of Wnt signaling and characterization of their role in pathophysiological processes, including osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and tumorigenesis, using computation-based virtual screening and chemical genomic approaches, in addition to the aforementioned ones.

										<li>I began my research career as a graduate student with the University of California San Francisco’s Child Trauma Research Project. This was a hospital-based program under the direction of Drs. Alicia Lieberman and Patricia Van Horn.  I worked within their program for three years and was intimately involved in their NIMH funded research project studying the efficacy and manualization of Child-Parent Psychotherapy for young children exposed to violence.  I interviewed mothers, conducted assessments with young children, coded video play sessions, and aided in data management. In addition to my research experience and work, I was trained and supervised in Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP).  After working with this research team, I became interested in the relationships that children had with their previously violent fathers.  I developed my own study, which became my doctoral dissertation, examining the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional implications of father visitation in domestic violence families.  Results revealed that preschool aged children with little to no contact with their fathers had higher rates of internalizing symptoms regardless of the severity of violence perpetrated by the father toward the mother.  In addition, children (especially boys) who had more contact with their fathers had fewer negative representations of their mothers in play.  These data suggest that ending the violence and continuing contact with fathers when possible can yield better outcomes for children.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I came to the Yale Child Study Center to complete my internship and postdoctoral training.  Over the last 5 years, I have been involved in patient-oriented research particularly focused on intervention development, evaluation and dissemination for families experiencing domestic violence.  I have published multiple papers and research studies from this work.  The most recently accepted manuscripts detail the results of a longitudinal study based on a successful grant application to the Ethel F. Donaghue Women’s Health Research at Yale. This study examined the impact of an innovative domestic violence home visit intervention (DVHVI) on repeat violence rates in the home, victims’ engagement in supportive and therapeutic services for themselves and their children. One hundred and nine women were recruited to participate in the longitudinal evaluation study (N= 53 intervention and 56 controls).  Women were interviewed at baseline, within 30 days of the initial domestic incident that required standard police intervention and qualified them for the study, then again at 6 months and 1 year following the initial interview (Stover, Berkman, Desai,&amp;Marans, in press).  Additionally, I have studied police record and clinical data on a large sample of domestic violence victims referred for services to help determine factors associated with engagement in the domestic violence outreach service (Stover, Rainey, Berkman&amp;Marans, 2008) and which components of the DVHVI might impact increased utilization of police (Stover, Poole,&amp;Marans, 2009).  I have been a co-investigator on the SAMHSA funded Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI) pilot evaluation.  The CFTSI is a 4-session secondary prevention model to prevent the development of PTSD following exposure to a traumatic event.  A randomized pilot was completed in the summer 2009 and findings suggest the CFTSI is a powerful PTSD prevention stategy.  We have begun dissemination training using a learning collaborative methodology in Child Advocacy Centers in New York City.  We’ve been collecting data on implementation of the CFTSI to aid in a future RTC.   I have responded to over 100 domestic violence incidents and provided in-home and office consultation to families following police intervention. Through my research and clinical work with these families, I became aware of the need for more coordinated and integrated treatments that address issues of domestic violence, substance abuse, trauma, and parenting that are not fully addressed by the intervention models that I have been trained to use with this population.  This led me to begin developing a new intervention approach (Integrated Father Treatment for DV).  I was recently awarded a small direct service grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and began the development of IFT-DV for fathers with co-morbid substance abuse and domestic violence problems who have children under the age of 7 years.  In conjunction, I have been awarded a K23 to develop and conduct a pilot evaluation of this integrated treatment for fathers.   This program of research will support the following research projects: 1) collection of quanitative data on the self-reported parenting stress, behaviors, and child-parent relationships of male perpetrators of intimate partner violence with comorbid substance abuse compared to matched controls and 2) manual development and initial evaluation via a Stage 1b randomized pilot of Integrated Father Treatment for Domestic Violence (IFT-DV) for this population of men which incorporates state-of-the-art substance abuse, domestic violence, and child-trauma treatment approaches.   Social service systems rarely acknowledge the status of men as fathers in the conceptualization and delivery of treatment for substance abuse or domestic violence.  Although there has been extensive focus on the treatment of mothers who abuse substances, are victims of intimate partner violence (IPV), or maltreat their children, there has been little consideration of the need for interventions for fathers with histories of co-morbid IPV and substance abuse.  The enormous rates of intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and child maltreatment constitute a major public health concern.   Given the high rates of comorbidity, there is a pressing need for more integrated evidence-based treatments to address the issues facing these families.

										<li>The main focus of my laboratory is the pathophysiology and therapy of diseases of the biliary tree (also called cholangiopathies). This is a large group of chronic liver diseases, congenital or acquired, that causes significant morbility and mortality in both the adult and pediatric population. The pathogenesis of biliary tree diseases is still elusive and, contrary to other areas of hepatology, effective treatment is still lacking. Liver transplantation remains the only treatment available for cases progressing to end-stage liver disease. On the other hand, many complications of liver transplantation involve the biliary tree, and biliary cells are intimately involved in liver repair and regeneration. Therefore, the basic scientific interest of the lab nicely complements the clinical interest of the group as it translates into the practice of transplant Hepatology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pathophysiology of cholangiopathies.&lt;br&gt;Previous work from my laboratory has contributed to the understanding of the normal physiology of biliary cells and to the identification of prototypic mechanisms for biliary damage for which a model human cholangiopathy exists (Fig. 1). Among them, the lab is now addressing the pathophysiology and treatment of Cystic Fibrosis cholangiopathy, polycystic liver disease and Alagille syndrome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cystic Fibrosis (CF) that alters the ability of the biliary epithelium to secrete Cl - through CFTR, and may leads to sclerosing cholangitis and biliary cirrhosis. We have shown that CFTR loss of function affects bicarbonate transport in biliary duct cells, which in certain circumstances this block can be overcome by purinergic signaling, by aminoglicoside antibiotics and by sulphonylureas. More recent on-going work focuses: a) on the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on biliary epithelia from CF mice models, and b) the use of cell transplantation strategies to treat genetic diseases of the biliary tree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Polycystic diseasesof the liver (PLD) are a group of extremely interesting developmental genetic cholangiopathies. In these diseases altered function of ciliary proteins causes dramatic changes in cholangiocyte biology, from altered development resulting in &quot;ductal plate malformations, to altered secretory response to sheer stress, to hyperproliferation, and stimulation of excessive portal fibrogenesis. We have described an increased expression of angiogenic factors in the biliary and cystic epithelium of patients with ADPKD and with Caroli Disease (Fig.2). Angiopoietin-1 and VEGF overexpression may have an autocrine stimulatory effect on cystic cholangiocyte growth. In collaboration with Dr. Somlo and the Yale ADPKD Center and thanks to a novel technique enabling the propagation of primary cholangiocyte cultures from wild-type and PLD transgenic mice, we are planning to explore the intracellular signaling pathways involved in autocrine angiogenic signaling in PLD cystic epithelium and to evaluate the potential inhibitory effect of VEGF signaling blockade on cyst growth in vivo using ADPKD mice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alagille Syndrome, a developmental disease of the biliary tree caused by an altered Jaggeded-1/Notch-2 signaling. The patient with Alagille syndrome has severe ductopenia, is jaundiced, and is severely itching, but rarely develops terminal liver diseases and liver fibrosis is negligible. Studies are ongoing to clarify the role of Notch in liver repair and development. In Alagille syndrome there is important cholestasis in the absence of ductular reaction and with an accumulation of intermediate hepatocytes, our hypothesis is that Notch signaling is needed for progenitor cell progression to a biliary phenotype.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another interest of my group is to understand the role of &quot;activated&quot; biliary cells and liver progenitor cells in liver repair mechanisms. The hypothesis is that, although both mature hepatocytes and biliary cells are able of substantial proliferation, this is restricted to experimental conditions and to rare human conditions, while in most cases of chronic liver diseases, liver repair requires the activation of a population of liver &quot;progenitor cells&quot; closely related to the epithelial cells of the terminal cholangioles. Specific hystochemical markers and a rigorous morphometric approach progenitor cells reaction are used to study with in a number of prototypic diseases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, the group is interested on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. HCC is one of the most frequent malignant neoplasms worldwide and a leading cause of mortality in the western cirrhotic population. HCC is also an important indication for liver transplantation. Many questions are still open concerning the optimal treatment of HCC. We are studying a prospectively followed up cohort of cirrhotic patients with incident HCC treated according to the BCLC staging system. Studies are planned to implement strategies to reduce recurrence in this population.

										<li>My longstanding interest is identification of neural circuitry abnormalities using multimodal neuroimaging techniques and investigation of how genetic variations influence neural circuitry to produce the clinical phenotypes of mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. My primary research interests lie in developing novel multimodal magnetic resonance imaging techniques to characterize the critical neural circuitry abnormalities underlying these disorders and identifying the specific genetic variations that contribute to them. Our work in translational research will contribute to elucidating the neuropathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disorders, aid in the development of new methods for early detection, and importantly, improve treatment of debilitating psychiatric illnesses. &lt;br&gt;1.   Methods of multimodal neuroimaging:&lt;br&gt;This project aims to use multimodal neuroimaging techniques to identify abnormalities of important neural circuitry in mental disorders. I developed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) methods to study the cingulum, a white matter structure important in cortico-limbic circuitry. My work demonstrated abnormalities in the anterior cingulum in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; however, findings demonstrate a different distribution of white matter abnormalities in the two disorders. I have also developed functional magnetic resonance imaging methods to study cortico-limbic functional connectivity to be integrated with DTI methods. Using these methodologies, I have obtained exciting findings that demonstrate altered structural and functional connectivity in cortico-limbic neural circuitry in mood disorders. Moreover, I have identified an association between structural and functional connectivity within this circuitry in bipolar disorder, providing some of the first evidence that these structural abnormalities may contribute to disruptions in the ability of the cortical region to modulate the functioning of limbic structure in mood disorders. &lt;br&gt;2.   Integration of multimodal neuroimaging and molecular genetics:&lt;br&gt;This project aims to develop translational research approaches of integrating molecular genetics with multimodal neuroimaging to identify novel effects of genetic variations on cortico-limbic circuitry in mental disorders. I have reported an important finding of the influence of genetic variation in neuregulin 1 on dorsal frontotemporal white matter connection abnormalities in schizophrenia. I have also recently authored psychiatric genetic papers in mood disorders including a paper that reports a novel finding of an association between variation in the vascular endothelial growth factor gene and cortico-limbic structure and on two papers on the association between the brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor gene/serotonin transporter protein gene and cortico-limbic structure/function in bipolar disorder.

										<li>										<ins class='diffins'>&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;In order to cope with an unpredictable variety of invading antigenic insults, the humoral immune system is able to generate an enormously diverse antibody repertoire.   This diversity is achieved through a complex series of molecular events that result in direct modification of Ig gene sequences with consequent changes in the specificity of the encoding antibodies.  In the first step of immune diversification, variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments of the Ig genes are assembled in immature B cells by a site-specific reaction known as V(D)J recombination.  This process occurs in the bone marrow early in B cell development and results in the production of a pool of mature B cells, each expressing a unique immunoglobulin B cell receptor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Upon antigenic stimulation of mature B cells, germinal centers are formed where, in mice and humans, two additional DNA modification reactions serve to further diversify the immune response: somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR).  SHM introduces point mutations into the variable region of Ig heavy and light chain genes.  This process underlies affinity maturation and results in the selection of a B cell that produces an antibody with high affinity for its target antigen. CSR is a deletion event that combines the variable region with different constant regions to result in the production of different immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG, IgE, or IgA).  The enzyme activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a cytidine deaminase that initiates these processes by introducing point mutations into the Ig variable regions (for SHM) and double-stranded DNA breaks into the Ig class switch regions (for CSR).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;During the first phase of SHM and CSR, AID converts cytosine to uracil to result in a uracil-guanine (U-G) mismatch.  Spontaneous U-G mismatches are normally corrected by high-fidelity base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR) pathways.  However, during the second phase of SHM and CSR, U-G mismatches are repaired by error-prone, low-fidelity BER and MMR pathways to yield mutations (for SHM) and DNA strand lesions (for CSR).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;The intrinsic activity of AID is that of a DNA mutator and tight regulation is required to restrict this activity to the appropriate cell type and target loci in order to avoid mutations throughout the genome.  However, aberrant targeting of AID activity contributes to translocations and point mutations of proto-oncogenes associated with many malignancies of B cell origin.  Thus, the mechanisms that determine which genes will be targeted by AID and the factors that regulate how mutations are subsequently processed are of central importance to our understanding of the etiology of malignant transformation.  Our lab currently has several projects underway that are directed at understanding the role of AID and associated factors in the pathogenesis of B cell malignancy:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;1)  The role of AID-associated DNA repair pathways in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphoma.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;2)  AID-induced epigenetic reprogramming in lymphoma through deamination of methylated CpG sites.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;3)  Somatic hypermutation of the mitochondrial genome by AID.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;4)  The role of AID in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;5)  Dysregulated expression of AID in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;6)  Regulation of the genotoxic threshold in B cells.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;7)  Differential targeting of the Ig loci for SHM versus CSR.&lt;/P&gt;</ins>

										<li>&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of my research program is to determine the role of non-coding RNAs in the lung pathologies. My background is in basic molecular biology with a focus on RNA biochemistry and structural biology. We have established the basic experimental tools necessary for the identification and modulation of expression of non-coding RNAs in various cellular compartments of the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found that miR-1 is specifically down-regulated by VEGF through VEGF receptor- 2 in the lung endothelium and mediates the angiogenic and inflammatory effects of VEGF. We have shown that miR-1 selectively controls the proliferative pathways downstream from VEGF and directly down-regulates the expression of Myeloproliferative Leukemia Oncogene (Mpl) mRNA by recruiting it to RISC (RNA Induced Silencing Complex). We have also found that, through regulation of Mpl, miR-1 controls the expression of adhesion molecules, namely P-selectin, on the lung endothelium, recruitment of Tcells, and severity of lung Th2 inflammation. We have developed vector-based and transgenic models for cell-specific expression of miRNAs and their targets in the lung. Using these tools, we have shown that miR-1/Mpl axis controls VEGF-mediated effects in lung angiogenesis and Th2 inflammation. These findings are not limited to animal models, and miR-1 is also regulated by VEGF and controls Mpl gene in human endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed two experimental models for studying the role of miRNAs in tumor progression and metastasis and are currently working on the molecular mechanism of miR-1 down-regulation in the endothelium. Recently we have expanded our studies to the other lung pathologies where VEGF plays a major role. In our collaboration with Dr. Patty Lee we are investigating the role of VEGF and VEGF-induced miRNAs in lung injury and COPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collaborate with J.Steitz, Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Institute) at Yale on the molecular aspects of our projects. We have also started a collaboration with the Dr D. Boffa, Dr J. Puchalski and Dr M. Pisani at Thoracic Oncology Program (TOP), Thorciac Interventional Program, and Pulmonary and Critical Care section respectively. Through this collaboration we collect samples from resected lung tumors for their miRNA content, and analyze the correlation of miRNA expression with lung tumor progression.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. TOOLS FOR CANCER GENETICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole-exome sequencing has created tremendous potential for revealing the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of many forms of cancer. However, somatic mutations occur at a significant frequency within tumors of most cancer types, and identification of the mutations that are on the causative trajectory from normal tissue to cancerous tissue is challenging. We are making algorithmic advances in clustering across discrete linear sequences to enact two powerful approaches to this identification. First, we are applying maximum likelihood approaches that we have developed for model-averaged clustering in discrete linear sequences to somatic amino acid replacement mutations appearing within mutated genes. Because amino acids of proteins that are functionally important are locally clustered in domains, mutations in multiple tumors that are functionally important to the development of cancer cluster in the linear sequence of relevant genes, allowing inference of relevance and function even in cases without three-dimensional protein structure. These clustering analyses have the power to demonstrate, for instance, cross-cancer consistency in the functional importance of the DNA binding domain of tumor suppressor p53, whether in a cancer with extensive exome data (ovarian serous adenocarcinoma) or in a cancer with much less extensive exome data (e.g. rectal adenocarcinoma).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we are applying evolutionary theory to the problem of identification of the genetic architecture of underlying cancer development. The path from normal to cancerous tissue is navigated by an evolutionary process. Tools from evolutionary theory have the potential to parse those mutations that are selected within cells on the path to cancer from those mutations that arise incidentally during the somatic evolution of cancer. The theory we are applying makes use of differences in expectation for synonymous and replacement mutations. Synonymous mutations are expected to have no functional impact; thus they yield a proxy expectation for the “incidental” mutations, whereas carcinogenic replacement mutations will spread within tumors more frequently and are clustered within gene sequence. Our theory also employs human population polymorphism data, which most evolutionary biologists believe can be largely assumed to be neutral. This data facilitates calibration of the probable impact of replacement changes to sequence conservation by eliminating the confounding variable of the degree of purifying selection, which decreases the number of mutations observed in some genes and allows others to accumulate many mutations with little impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are extending this approach to estimating selection intensity on mutations along the trajectory toward cancer, revealing the level of selection within tumors for replacement mutations compared to synonymous mutations. This evolutionary analysis is ideal for detecting the history of selection on sites within genes during the evolution of cancer from exome sequencing data. These sites, particularly when representing gain-of-function mutations, will help identify candidate loci for pharmacological intervention. This approach will be applied to identify targets for pharmacological intervention and design “personal genomics” drugs appropriate for the genetics of individual cancers in individual patients. As a component of that project, we are constructing an “active-experiment” cancer exome database to facilitate further bioinformatics investigation of cancer exome data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS FOR NONLINEAR MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DISEASE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am developing probabilistic statistical methodologies for the mathematical modeling of disease emergence and spread. Robustness of models has usually been assessed by techniques that explore the relative impact and importance of parameters upon the mathematical behavior of the function and the mathematical predictions of the model. For diverse reasons including the difficulty or cost of acquisition, restrictions due to privacy, and urgency of analysis in the case of outbreaks, data for estimation of epidemiological parameters is often sparse. Evaluating a model with the “best point estimate” of sparse data may convey a misleading certitude to policy makers basing decisions on deterministic models of disease outbreak, spread, and persistence. Conversely, policy makers who are aware that models are parameterized with limited data may be dismissive of deterministic predictions that yet have significant validity. These issues may be most straightforwardly addressed by probabilistic sensitivity analysis of parameters and full uncertainty analysis of outcomes of interest. These analyses amount to accommodating the uncertainty of parameters directly into an analysis by probabilistically resampling data or likely distributions of parameters to calculate a probabilistic distribution of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, one of the most common modeling approaches for evaluating interventions is based on differential equation models of disease such as the standard Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. In the SIR model and other more complex constructions, a closed-form solution can often be calculated for the basic reproductive number, &lt;em&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the average number of secondary infections that would follow upon a primary infection in a na&#239;ve host population. In a population where there is preexisting immunity due to either vaccination or previous infection, the effective reproductive number, &lt;em&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is defined as the average number of secondary infections following a primary infection in a population that is not completely na&#239;ve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is of particular interest in public health because interventions that bring its value below 1 are predicted to eradicate the disease. This deterministic threshold of is proposed as the basis for policy decisions regarding the level of interventions that should be implemented. However, the best estimates for the parameters that are needed for the closed-form solution of are inevitably inexact. To address this point, sensitivity analyses are frequently performed to evaluate models and explore the relationship between model parameters and outcomes. In such deterministic sensitivity analyses, one or more parameters are perturbed and the corresponding effects on outcomes are examined. The perturbation can be done either by evaluating the effect of arbitrarily small changes in parameter values (e.g. &#177; 1%) or by evaluating the effects across a range of values defined by plausible probability density functions. Because the values of other parameters are held fixed at best point estimates, these strategies do not account for interaction effects in non-linear dynamic models, and do not assess global uncertainty in outcome. Uncertainty analysis has been recommended for many fields of mathematical modeling, including medical decision making, as an optimal approach to presenting models. In the case of dynamic transmission modeling, however, authoritative best practices have not included uncertainty analyses. Modeling guidelines recommend probabilistic sensitivity analysis, in which both global parameter uncertainty and output uncertainty are addressed, as the best practice method for uncertainty analysis. Yet that ideal has not been extended to dynamic transmission models, for which its implementation has been challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing methods for global probabilistic sensitivity analysis that allow the contribution of each parameter to model outcomes to be investigated while also taking into account the uncertainty of other model parameters. Uncertainty in parameter values can be accounted for by sampling randomly from empirical data or from probability density functions fit to empirical data. Depending on the instance, such sampling techniques include bootstrapping, Monte Carlo sampling, and Latin hypercube sampling. The model output generated from parameter samples can then be analyzed using linear (e.g. partial correlation coefficients), monotonic (e.g. partial rank correlation coefficients) and non-monotonic statistical tests (e.g. sensitivity index) to determine the contribution of each parameter to the variation in output values. Indeed, for a global sensitivity analysis to yield probabilities associated with outcomes that are of greatest utility to policy makers, probabilistic analyses of parameter uncertainty must be carried through to the model outcomes. For example, the probability of eradication of an epidemic is sensitive to both levels of vaccination and treatment. Moreover, a policy based on the analysis of data should take into consideration not only the best estimate of necessary action, but also the uncertainty around that outcome estimate. The former policy advice, indicating an exact cline of treatment and vaccination that should put into abeyance an influenza epidemic, is very different and can be misleading compared to the probabilistic statement, which gives a policymaker a predictive probability that a particular policy of treatment and vaccination will put into abeyance an influenza epidemic. Similar approaches applied with a next-generation matrix to rabies vaccination in Tanzania were able to demonstrate that WHO goals in two districts of 70% vaccination coverage of dogs had more than enough probability to control rabies, if only the process to achieve those not impractical goals could be mustered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A public health decision maker would find most useful the assignment of the probability of eradication to each level of treatment, so that they may precisely weigh the cost of intervention against the potential for failure. These probabilistic outcome distributions also feed forward extremely fluidly with cost-effectiveness estimation, a field which has embraced uncertainty analysis but which has until our recent work not incorporated uncertainty from nonlinear infectious disease models into calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How parvoviruses enter their host cell and traffic to the nucleus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Parvoviruses do not have a lipid envelope, and so cannot deliver their virions into the host cell by fusing with its plasma or endosomal membranes.  These viruses have developed an alternative strategy to breach their host cell&#39;s outer membrane and gain entry into the cytoplasm.  We have recently shown that the compact, icosahedral virion of the murine parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice, MVM deploys a lipolytic enzyme, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) that is expressed at the N-terminus of the minor coat protein, VP1.  This region of VP1 is normally sequestered within the viral shell, but is extruded during the entry process as a capsid-tethered domain, via an 8&#197; pore that extends through the prominent 5-fold cylinder. [Figure] In addition to the PLA2 domain, the extruded VP1 N-terminus also displays a number of small protein interaction domains predicted to engage both ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 family, involved in endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, and nuclear transport proteins of the alpha-importin family.  We are currently collaborating with Dr. Michael Hodsdon, in our Department, to determine the structure of this polypeptide domain by NMR spectroscopy, in order to understand how it unfolds and refolds during its transition through the 5-fold pore.  The sequential conformational shifts within the particle that allow this  transition to occur as the virion transits its entry pathway, exposing first its VP2 N-termini, then its VP1 N-termini and ultimately its DNA are being analyzed using X-ray crystallography and asymmetric cryo-electron microscopy, in a collaboration with Drs. Susan Hafenstein and Michael Rossmann at Purdue University.  Finally, we are using reverse genetics combined with differential real-time PCR, sub-cellular fractionation and in situ imaging techniques, to explore the roles of the VP1 N-terminal domain in the trans-cytosolic trafficking and nuclear import of MVM virions.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulating the oncoselectivity of parvoviruses in human tumor models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Many of the rodent parvoviruses will bind to and enter human cells with high efficiency, but fail to initiate gene expression, replicate their genomes, generate progeny or spread through the culture, unless the host cell is neoplastically transformed.  As a consequence, these viruses are promising candidates as oncolytic agents for cancer therapy, particularly in situations where other treatments have proven ineffective.  Our current efforts are directed toward understanding, at the molecular level, why cellular changes that accompany oncogenic transformation promote viral growth, and how we can use this knowledge to further improve the efficacy of the virus in tumor eradication.  Since tumorigenesis normally involves loss of genomic integrity, tumor cells carry many mutations that are secondary to those causing the transformed phenotype.  To avoid studying or selecting for viral traits that represent adaptations to such “collateral” transformed cell properties, we are using host cells that have been transformed in a stepwise fashion with activated oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor knock-downs.  Currently we are exploring the contribution of the viral capsid and initiating promoter to the discrimination between normal and transformed cells, using stepwise transformed human fibroblasts and melanocytes, the latter being a model for malignant melanoma.  These studies are directing strategies for selecting more oncotropic versions of these critical oncoselective elements, using gene shuffling and degenerate promoter library approaches.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translational studies on a newly-discovered human bocavirus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a human parvovirus that was discovered in 2005 and shown to be present in a significant fraction of bronchioalveolar samples from children presenting in the clinic with respiratory tract infection.  We have been developing tools that will allow us to study this virus in the clinic, and to explore its biology in the laboratory.  Using baculovirus technology, we have derived HBoV virus-like particles with which we have developed diagnostic assays for HBoV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies.  We have used these to show that infection with this virus is common in very young infants.  Currently we are involved in developing prospective and retrospective seroepidemiological screens, in an attempt to identify potential clinical sequelae of infection with this ubiquitous agent.  In addition, we are attempting to grow the virus in cell culture, in order to study its non-structural polypeptides, particularly the function of the unique bocaviral NP1 protein.&lt;/p&gt;

Parvoviral induction of complete tumor regression has been achieved in several syngeneic transplantable tumor models in immunocompetent rodent hosts, and often results in immunization of the animal against subsequent transplantation of cells of the same tumor, even at high input numbers, suggesting that some aspect of parvovirus infection elicits a strong anti-tumor immune response.  This project utilizes a mouse melanoma model system to explore whether parvovirus-induced cell death proceeds via an immunogenic, rather than tolerogenic, pathway, by examining the expression of phagocytic engulfment signals on the infected cell surface, coupled with the secretion of soluble damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules, such as HMGB1 and Hsp72.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Characterizing the unique chromatin assembled during parvoviral DNA replication:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  during the S-phase following infection, autonomous parvoviruses inveigle host cells to replicate the linear, single-stranded viral DNA chromosome, instead of the cellular genome.  Part of the virus’ replication strategy involves the elaboration of a unique form of chromatin, which ChIP analysis suggests incorporates both cellular histones and many copies of NS1, the major viral non-structural protein.  This project explores the replication of an otherwise wildtype viral genome rendered artificially devoid of NS1 binding sites throughout its entire NS1 gene, capsid gene and/or 3’ untranslated region.  2D gel electrophoresis and nuclease protection assays will be used to look for stalling or pausing of replication forks through the capsid region, and to characterize packaging intermediates generated by mutant, compared to wildtype, virus.&lt;/p&gt;</ins>

										<li>Examples of some major scientific accomplishments: Advanced the Hypothesis of “Frontostriatal Dysfunction in Addiction”. Her work has provided behavioral and biochemical evidence that drug-induced neuroadaptations in cortical and subcortical brain regions result in dysfunctional decision-making abilities and loss of impulse control that, in combination with enhancements of incentive motivation, may contribute to compulsive, habit-driven, behavior in addiction. This theory has received significant attention and has had a major impact on current work in drug addiction research ranging from basic molecular mechanisms, to neurophysiology, and to human neuropsychology and imaging studies. It is, consequently, a major research focus in the field of addiction biology. Her published work in this area has had far reaching impact and includes many “firsts”, for example, showing drug-induced cognitive deficits in orbitofrontal cortex in monkeys as well as in rodent models. Most recently she has extended this work to examine the neurobiology of goal directed actions vs. habitual behavior. This paper was the first to demonstrate a selective modulation of behavior by sex chromosome genes, completely independent of gonadal hormone status.  Using a mouse model that segregates sex chromosomes (XX vs. XY) from gonadal phenotype (ovaries vs. testes), she found a sex difference in the rate of habit formation whereby XX mice show faster habit formation compared to XY mice, irrespective of hormonal ‘sex’ status.  These data provide new insight into the neurobiological bases of sex differences in the etiology of human habitual or compulsive psychopathologies, such as drug addiction.   Together these findings have also had a major influence because Dr. Taylor’s work and emphasis has been on delineating cellular/molecular mechanisms the underlie complex psychological processes. Some examples are listed below.&lt;br&gt;Jentsch, J.D. and Taylor, J.R.

Nature Neuroscience, 10(11):1398-400&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discovered that Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a critical component for cortico-limbic-striatal plasticity, in the nucleus accumbens regulates the ability of reward-associated stimuli (conditioned reinforcers) to motivate and control goal-directed behavior. This paper established BDNF as a novel regulator of cocaine reward. BDNF is now considered critical for cognition and motivation and recent evidence in humans suggests polymorphisms in the BDNF gene in addiction and cognition. Also first established that another molecule involved in neuronal plasticity, Cdk5, also regulated cocaine’s effects on conditioned reinforcers and accumbens plasticity including alterations in dendritic spines.  These studies have significantly advanced our understanding of mechanisms associated with neuroadaptive brain responses to cocaine and how drug and reward-associated cues play a role in addiction and relapse.&lt;br&gt;Horger, B.A., Iyasere, C.A., Berhow, M.T., Messer, C.J., Nestler, E.J., and Taylor, J.R.

Journal of Neuroscience, 27(47):12967-76&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Characterized how dysfunction of dopaminergic/cAMP/PKA signaling in cortico-limbic-striatal circuits underlies drug-induced alterations in reward-related learning and motivation. In addition, demonstrated how sex differences, and estrogen, modify in these behaviors in rodent models of addiction. This elegant work on the effects of drug exposure on appetitive Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, conditioned reinforcement and motivation has stimulated intense research in the role of learning and memory processes in drug addiction, and how reward-associated memories can influence motivational processes. Several recent reviews by other influential investigators have found this work important and ground-breaking.&lt;br&gt;Taylor, J.R. and Jentsch, J.D.

Memory reconsolidation was recently “re-discovered”, and is now widely considered to be a process by which previously formed memories can be rendered labile and susceptible to disruption. This may provide a great opportunity for treatments of post-traumatic stress disorder, phobias and several psychiatric conditions. Her recent Nature Neuroscience paper was the first to demonstrate that reconsolidation can be enhanced resulting in increased memory strength. This demonstration has a great impact on our understanding mechanisms of this memory process and, it also opens up a number of new avenues for potential clinical applications utilizing manipulations of reconsolidation in a number of mental disorders including understanding the development and treatment of addiction, as hypothesized in her Nature Neuroscience review.&lt;br&gt;Jentsch, J.D., Olausson, P., Nestler, E.J. and Taylor, J.R (2002) Stimulation of Protein Kinase A Activity in Rat Amygdala enhances Reward-Related Learning Biological Psychiatry, 52:111-118&lt;br&gt;Tronson N.C., Wiseman, S.L., Olausson, P., and Taylor, J.R (2006) Bidirectional behavioral plasticity of memory reconsolidation depends on amygdalar protein kinase A.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My scholarly work has primarily focused on two areas: 1) the study of resilience among vulnerable populations; and, 2) evaluation research and community research methodology. This work is conceptualized within a social justice perspective, occurs within multiple social-ecological levels (such as the individual, the family, peers, the school, the neighborhood or community, and the broader culture), and generally takes place in a variety of community settings that involve mostly at risk, traumatized, or clinical populations. Examples of some of these population groups include: bereaved young adults; “sandwiched generation” women caregivers; children of mothers with serious mental illness; maltreated children or children in foster care; urban, low-income adolescents; and persons in recovery from mental illness or addiction. Some of my research involves randomized controlled trials and some involves evaluations of programs or services carried out by public agencies or community-based organizations. Most of this work has been collaborative and conducted in partnership with other investigators, community-based organizations, state and municipal agencies, and community stakeholders. In my evaluation research, I study the operations and effectiveness of programs and services designed for at risk, traumatized, or clinical populations. To the extent possible, my research is intended to inform professional practice, the design of new programs, the transformation of settings and communities, or the development of data-driven and effective policy. Below I summarize my scholarly work on resilience and research methodology, and describe its relationship to other scholarly areas, including: the prevention of adolescent substance use, positive youth development, adaptation and resilience promotion with various vulnerable target populations, culture and diversity, the use of data to inform practice and policy development, and meta-science. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Resilience.&lt;/strong&gt; Resilience is characterized by normative development despite adverse circumstances. My colleagues and I have sought to identify risk and protective factors associated with resilience among vulnerable populations, and to promote resilience among at-risk groups. My early research examined risk processes among women who had primary caregiving responsibilities for a child as well as an elder family member, which led to a randomized trial of the effectiveness of mutual support for these “sandwiched generation” women. This trial was among the first to examine the health impacts of mutual support on the children of caregivers. In other studies, my colleagues and I have examined resilience processes among children of mothers with serious mental illnesses and bereaved young adults. More recently, we have studied risk and protective factors for various outcomes involving maltreated and foster care children in the child welfare system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My colleagues and I have also conducted trials of community-based programs among adolescent populations at-risk for substance use and other problem behaviors. Initially, we examined the effectiveness of teaching decision-making skills in school settings to urban, small-town adolescents and their parents in order to prevent adolescent substance use; we then adapted this intervention for use with urban, low-income adolescents in after-school settings by incorporating positive youth development principles and cultural heritage activities. Next, we developed a school-based mentoring intervention for urban, low-income adolescents to prevent substance use and promote resilience. All of these interventions were successful in preventing substance use. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been fortunate to collaborate with other investigators to examine the effectiveness of interventions that promote community adaptation for various clinical populations. These have included randomized controlled trials of community-based programs, such as crisis-respite services for persons with serious mental illness or peer support services for persons in recovery from serious mental illness, as well as large-scale studies of the effectiveness of statewide services, such as community support services for persons in recovery; system of care services for children with serious emotional disorders; and multi-systemic therapy for juvenile offenders and their families. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation and community research methodology.&lt;/strong&gt; For many years, I have had a scholarly interest in evaluation and community research methodology, and at times, this interest has led to research projects that overlap with my work on resilience. My interest in methodology stems from the challenge posed by the observation that human behavior is subject to multiple socio-ecological influences that operate simultaneously, thus making it difficult to determine causality. Some of the work that my colleagues and I have done shows how various forms of bias influence causal inferences about external validity in community-based randomized trials. My colleagues and I have also introduced various methodological innovations in community research, such as the term “panel accretion” to describe participants who are added to a panel study after a prevention trial begins; a “convergence index” to depict the similarity of sibling risk within families; and a system-level approach to assessing service access within a system of care. More recently, we have extended this work to describe cultural influences, broadly defined, on community-based research. This scholarly work has combined my interests in methodology and resilience, and provided an opportunity to examine empirically a longstanding teaching interest in culture and human diversity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also had an abiding interest in meta-science, that is, the nature and structure of science, how it is conducted, and its historic and philosophical foundations. I have written about the philosophical roots underlying the emerging field of community science and mixed methods research, and have argued for greater theoretical and methodological pluralism in community-based research in order to understand better the multi-level influences on human behavior. My colleagues and I have also argued how pluralism is enhanced through interdisciplinary approaches and mixed methods, and we illustrated this by showing how mixed methods could be incorporated into experimental or quasi-experimental designs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As principal investigator of the evaluation of the Interdisciplinary Research Consortium on Stress, Self-control, and Addiction (IRCSSA) at Yale, I have been fortunate to be a part of a group of researchers who are focused on interdisciplinary research, and specifically, interdisciplinary team science. In this connection, I served as an advisor to the national evaluation of the nine Interdisciplinary Research Centers funded by NIH (of which IRCSSA is one), and serve as team science advisor to the faculty scholar training program on Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women’s Health at Yale. This work is at the forefront of the emerging field known as the “Science of Team Science.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scholarship on research methodology integrates my research, teaching, and applied interests by providing opportunities for collaboration as a co-investigator on community-based studies conducted by colleagues; as a consultant to national, state, or municipal agencies; and as a testifying expert on federal class action litigation in which rigorous evaluation research can inform judicial decisions and subsequent policy. These varying roles blend research, practice, and policy development, and provide opportunities for the teaching and mentoring of pre- and postdoctoral fellows and faculty.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;strong&gt;STUDIES OF BASAL
GANGLIA FUNCTION IN MICE&lt;/strong&gt;.  The basal ganglia, consisting of the
striatum (caudate-putamen) and related subcortical structures, have
historically been considered to have primarily motor functions; but it has
become increasingly clear that they are also involved in a variety of cognitive
and affective processes.  Disruption of normal basal ganglia function is
seen in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive
disorder, Tourette syndrome, and drug addiction.&lt;br&gt;    The striatum has been divided into distinct functional
regions, though both the anatomical subdivisions and the functions with which
they are associated remain approximate and subject to debate.  The ventral
striatum, consisting of the nucleus accumbens and related structures, has a
well-documented role in reward and reward-driven learning, and has been
extensively researched in the context of drug addiction.  The dorsal
striatum (caudate and putamen, in primates) is thought to have a role in the
formation of motor and cognitive patterns and in forms of implicit learning,
including the formation of habits.&lt;br&gt;    The Pittenger laboratory is focused on the better
understanding of the mechanisms of dorsal striatum-dependent habit-like
learning, and of the consequences of its perturbation in various
neuropsychiatric conditions.  We conduct our researches primarily in mice,
which allows us to take advantage of sophisticated reverse genetic techniques
to perturb the striatal circuitry in molecularly precise ways and to target
specific striatal subregions and neuronal subtypes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL
BEHAVIORAL ASSAYS.&lt;/strong&gt;  A challenge in this line of work is that
striatum-dependent learning processes have been less studied than those
depending on other brain regions, such as hippocampus, cerebellum, and
amygdala, and have barely been studied in mice at all prior to the last few
years.  A major thrust of our efforts has therefore been the establishment
and validation of behavioral assays of striatal function in mice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CREB IN
STRIATAL SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY AND STRIATUM-DEPENDENT LEARNING&lt;/strong&gt;.  Dr.
Pittenger’s initial work in this direction began during his Ph.D. studies with
recent Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, with the production of transgenic mice
expressing a dominant-negative mutant of the ubiquitous transcription factor
CREB specifically in the striatum.  CREB has long been known to have a
conserved role in the establishment of long-lasting plasticity; for example,
Dr. Pittenger’s earlier thesis work confirmed its role in the hippocampus in
the stabilization of spatial learning (Pittenger &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, 2002).&lt;br&gt;    However, the role of CREB-regulated processes in dorsal
striatum-dependent habit-like learning had not previously been directly
studied.  We found that inhibition of CREB function in the dorsal striatum
disrupts cortico-striatal synaptic plasticity and several striatum-dependent
learning tasks (Pittenger &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;J Neurosci&lt;/em&gt;, 2006).  This study
represented the first time that the detailed mechanisms of striatum-dependent
learning had been examined using genetic tools in mice.  It also
established a new paradigm (adapted from earlier work in rats) for the analysis
of such learning processes in mice, laying the methodological groundwork for
further analyses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS
BETWEEN LEARNING SYSTEMS&lt;/strong&gt;.  More recent behavioral work in the
Pittenger laboratory has examined the interaction of dorsal striatum-dependent
learning with other types of learning and other circuits in the brain.  We
developed a novel cued water maze task for mice (again taking previous work in
rats as our starting point), and found that the animals could learn to navigate
using distinct strategies driven by either local or spatial cues.  Lesions
of the dorsal striatum disrupted cue-driven search, while lesions of the dorsal
hippocampus disrupted spatial navigation.&lt;br&gt;    The remarkable finding came
when we looked at interactions: hippocampal lesions not only left cued learning
intact, they enhanced it.  Conversely, striatal lesions not only left
spatial learning unimpaired, they made it better.  The same effect was see
in our transgenic mice, in which striatal CREB is inhibited and corticostriatal
plasticity is impaired: these animals have impaired cued learning but enhanced
spatial learning (Lee &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, 2008).&lt;br&gt;    This study was the first to document this sort of
bi-directional enhancement after discrete brain lesions.  We interpret the
counter-intuitive results in terms of the multiple memory systems theory of
learning.  This theory posits that the mammalian brain contains several
different learning systems, adapted for different types of environmental
contingencies.  For example, the hippocampus is adapted for the processing
of spatial or relational information, while the dorsal striatum is hypothesized
to be adapted for the gradual acquisition of discrete cue associations. 
Under normal circumstances they are activated in parallel; with training,
whichever system is best able to master the relevant environmental contingency
(e.g. to predict reward) comes to dominate.  But in circumstances where
two systems produce disparate behavioral outcomes they can destructively
interfere with one another, or ‘compete’; this is particularly likely early in
training, before differential reinforcement has led to the predominance of one
system.  We interpret the enhancement of the function subserved by one
system after manipulations of the other as evidence for the alleviation of such
competition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRIATAL
SUBREGIONS&lt;/strong&gt;.  Our ongoing work in this direction seeks to refine our
understanding of the structures underlying cued and spatial learning and their
interaction.  The dorsal striatum is not a homogeneous structure;
different areas receive projections from functionally distinct regions of
cortex and are therefore likely to process different sorts of
information.  In particular, the dorsolateral striatum (the putamen, in
primates) receives projections from primary sensory and motor cortices, and
therefore is likely to be involved in acquisition of cue-driven learning such
as that we are seeing in the water maze task.  The dorsomedial striatum,
in contrast, receives input from association cortices and may have a more
general role.  Indeed, studies in rats suggest such a dissociation, and
our own preliminary data suggest that restricted lesions of the dorsomedial
striatum have very different effects from larger disruptions of the whole
dorsal striatum.&lt;br&gt;    We are addressing the question of functional
dissociation within the dorsal striatum in several ways.  First, we seek
to better define what is meant by the ‘dorsomedial striatum’ and ‘dorsolateral
striatum’ in this context by examining striatal activation by water maze
learning in an unbiased way; we have found the different tasks to produce
distinct patterns of striatal activation, enen though they share all sensory,
motor, and motivational characteristics.  Second, we are targeting lesions
to putative striatal subregions and examining the behavioral
consequences.  Finally, we are targeting disruptions of CREB-mediated
transcription to striatal subregions using recombinant adeno-associated viruses
(rAAV), to see whether disruption in a restricted subregion is sufficient to
recapitulate the effects we see when CREB is inhibited throughout the dorsal
striatum in our transgenic mice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW METHODOLOGIES FOR
PROBING AND PERTURBING STRIATAL FUNCTION&lt;/strong&gt;.  This latter project
highlights another theme in the Pittenger laboratory’s research portfolio, the
development of novel tools for precise manipulation of specific mechanisms and
cell populations in the dorsal striatum, and in other neural circuits. 
The production of transgenic mice allowed restriction of a molecular
manipulation to the dorsal striatum, but it does not suffice for more specific
targeting of manipulations to discrete subregions.  For that purpose we
are now using engineered rAAV vectors to deliver our CREB dominant negative
construct, and other gene products, into defined brain areas by stereotaxic
surgery.  A first-generation vector, which we are currently using, allows
expression of a CREB dominant negative in target brain regions of varying
size.  A second-generation vector, which is under development and working
well in vitro, permits the temporal regulation of the delivered gene, such that
it can be turned on and off; this will allow behavioral experimental designs
not possible with static manipulations, such as dissociating learning from
recall.&lt;br&gt;    Another major effort in the laboratory is the targeting of
defined striatal cell populations.  The striatum, like any other brain
region or structure, is not homogenous; it is made up of distinct populations
of principal cells and a number of different classes of interneurons. 
Different cell types are likely to make different contributions to striatal
function, and perturbation of one or another cell type may result in discrete
behavioral abnormalities or (in humans) patterns of psychopathology.  We
have developed a method, combining recombinant viruses with transgenic technologies,
to perturb defined cell populations, without disrupting similar cells elsewhere
in the brain or neighboring cells of different types.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MODELING
PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE&lt;/strong&gt;.  We are applying this technology to model
neuropsychiatric conditions affecting the striatum, especially Tourette
syndrome.  This represents a third focus of the laboratory.  Modeling
psychiatric disease in animals has proven enormously challenging, because
etiology is often obscure and symptomatology is often difficult to translate to
non-verbal species.  We believe that the development of valid models
hinges on a sufficient degree of understanding of pathophysiology to ensure
validity when translating to animals.&lt;br&gt;    Fortunately, studies at Yale and elsewhere are beginning to
produce such understanding in the case of Tourette syndrome. We are using
genetic methods to produce putative models of Tourette syndrome based both on
post-mortem findings (in collaboration with Flora Vaccarino) and on genetic
insights (in collaboration with Matt State).  These animals are then being
tested in a variety of behavioral assays to assess their recapitulation of
Tourette syndrome phenomenology, explore secondary and tertiary consequences of
the initial manipulations, and investigate the response to both established and
novel medications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A FOCUS ON
TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH: NEW MEDICATIONS FOR OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)&lt;/strong&gt;.  The final focus of the Pittenger
laboratory is also translational.  Dr. Pittenger is Director of the Yale
OCD Research Clinic, where he has found glutamate-modulating medications to be
of potential benefit in the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (a condition in which basal ganglia dysfunction is implicated). 
We are examining the behavioral and molecular effects of such glutamate-modulating
drugs in animals, to better understand their role in patients with this and
related conditions.  &lt;br&gt;    As new animal models of
disorders of the basal ganglia, like OCD, become available, we hope to use this
translational approach to advance our understanding both of the normal role of
the basal ganglia in behavior and its perturbation in disease, and to develop
new generations of therapeutics for the psychiatric population.

										<li>										&lt;strong&gt;STUDIES OF BASAL
GANGLIA FUNCTION IN MICE&lt;/strong&gt;.  The basal ganglia, consisting of the
striatum (caudate-putamen) and related subcortical structures, have
historically been considered to have primarily motor functions; but it has
become increasingly clear that they are also involved in a variety of cognitive
and affective processes.  Disruption of normal basal ganglia function is
seen in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive
disorder, Tourette syndrome, and drug addiction.&lt;br&gt;    The striatum has been divided into distinct functional
regions, though both the anatomical subdivisions and the functions with which
they are associated remain approximate and subject to debate.  The ventral
striatum, consisting of the nucleus accumbens and related structures, has a
well-documented role in reward and reward-driven learning, and has been
extensively researched in the context of drug addiction.  The dorsal
striatum (caudate and putamen, in primates) is thought to have a role in the
formation of motor and cognitive patterns and in forms of implicit learning,
including the formation of habits.&lt;br&gt;    The Pittenger laboratory is focused on the better
understanding of the mechanisms of dorsal striatum-dependent habit-like
learning, and of the consequences of its perturbation in various
neuropsychiatric conditions.  We conduct our researches primarily in mice,
which allows us to take advantage of sophisticated reverse genetic techniques
to perturb the striatal circuitry in molecularly precise ways and to target
specific striatal subregions and neuronal subtypes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL
BEHAVIORAL ASSAYS.&lt;/strong&gt;  A challenge in this line of work is that
striatum-dependent learning processes have been less studied than those
depending on other brain regions, such as hippocampus, cerebellum, and
amygdala, and have barely been studied in mice at all prior to the last few
years.  A major thrust of our efforts has therefore been the establishment
and validation of behavioral assays of striatal function in mice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CREB IN
STRIATAL SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY AND STRIATUM-DEPENDENT LEARNING&lt;/strong&gt;.  Dr.
Pittenger’s initial work in this direction began during his Ph.D. studies with
recent Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, with the production of transgenic mice
expressing a dominant-negative mutant of the ubiquitous transcription factor
CREB specifically in the striatum.  CREB has long been known to have a
conserved role in the establishment of long-lasting plasticity; for example,
Dr. Pittenger’s earlier thesis work confirmed its role in the hippocampus in
the stabilization of spatial learning (Pittenger &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, 2002).&lt;br&gt;    However, the role of CREB-regulated processes in dorsal
striatum-dependent habit-like learning had not previously been directly
studied.  We found that inhibition of CREB function in the dorsal striatum
disrupts cortico-striatal synaptic plasticity and several striatum-dependent
learning tasks (Pittenger &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;J Neurosci&lt;/em&gt;, 2006).  This study
represented the first time that the detailed mechanisms of striatum-dependent

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Our research addresses three interrelated problems in the immunobiology and pathology of vascular endothelial cells. First, we examine and analyze the consequences that ensue when human T lymphocytes recognize specific antigens presented by human vascular endothelial cells, pericytes or smooth muscle cells in comparison to recognition of antigens presented by professional antigen presenting cells or by tissue cells (e.g., fibroblasts). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, we examine the signaling pathways activated by T cells or their products (e.g., cytokines) or by B cell products (e.g., antibodies) and the transcriptional regulation of cytokine-induced molecules, such as leukocyte adhesion molecules, within vascular endothelial cells. We also study how these signals differentially affect various segements of the vascular tree such as arteries, capillaries or post-capillary venules. Third, we analyze the pathways of cell injury (e.g., apoptosis) in vascular endothelial cells induced by leukocytes and their products as well as responses made by endothelial cells to resist such injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our experimental approaches involve use of normal and genetically-modified (i.e., transfected) cell populations in culture, use of chimeric animals, (e.g., immunodeficient mice doubly engrafted with human blood vessels and with human lymphocytes), and use of discarded human tissues from control and disease settings. These studies may lead to novel, vascular cell-directed therapies for modifying immune and inflammatory diseases.

are born within a determinate lineage.  The single exception is a pair
of primordial germ cells, which divide an unspecified number of times
to populate the gonad.   These proliferative germ cells bear several
hallmarks of stem cells:  they require a niche in the distal end of the
gonad for maintenance, they self-renew, and they retain totipotency,
since they can generate every cell type of the subsequent generation. 
Their maintenance also requires Notch signaling.  We have used a
functional genomics approach to investigate the properties of germline
stem cells in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;, and identified a large set of genes
expressed primarily in germline stem cells. Many of these genes encode
proteins predicted to function in chromatin-binding and transcriptional
regulation, in RNA binding and RNA regulation, and as stress-activated
chaperones. Efforts are underway in the lab to analyze the function of
these genes in germline stem cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Germ cell-specific organelles&lt;/strong&gt;.  In &lt;em&gt;C.  elegans&lt;/em&gt;,
the germ line is set aside within the first few embryonic divisions. 
As each cell in the embryonic P lineage divides, it produces another P
cell that retains germ cell characteristics, and a somatic cell that
does not.  Within four divisions, the P lineage is completely
segregated from all somatic lineages.  One feature that distinguishes
germ cells from somatic cells is the presence of unique cytoplasmic,
RNA-rich, granular organelles, whose exact function remains
mysterious.  In &lt;em&gt;C.  elegans&lt;/em&gt;, these organelles, called P
granules, are provided maternally and segregate with the P lineage
during the initial embryonic divisions.  All germ cells born from the P
lineage contain P granules (except mature sperm).  Several protein
components of P granules have been identified, but their contribution
to P granule function and germline viability remains unclear.  We have
identified two novel, related proteins that localize exclusively to
embyonic P granules.  They are not found in other cell compartments or
on P granules in larvae or adults.  These genes are called &lt;em&gt;meg-1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;meg-2&lt;/em&gt;
(maternal-effect germ cell-defective), and they are required for larval
germ cell proliferation and normal P granule morphology.  &lt;em&gt;meg-1&lt;/em&gt; has genetic interactions with core components  of P granules that suggests that &lt;em&gt;meg-1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;meg-2&lt;/em&gt;
are required to regulate certain aspects of P granule function in the
early P blastomeres during the time that somatic and germ fates are
intermingled. Current efforts in the lab are directed toward defining
the exact function of MEG-1 and MEG-2 and dissecting how P granules
affect transcript stability in the early embryo.&lt;/p&gt;</ins>

										<li>Professor Tschudi’s studies focus on the biology of trypanosomes the
causative agents of devastating diseases in Africa and South America.
Most projects in the laboratory utilize bioinformatics and modern
genetic techniques to identify and dissect parasite-specific functions.
The laboratory has developed several methodologies for creating mutants
and has been instrumental in establishing a number of techniques to
study processes at the biochemical level. These approaches will lead to
a better understanding of the infectious cycle of the parasite, which
involves a mammalian as well as an insect host. The long term goal is
to identify candidate molecules that can be targets for chemotherapy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most recently, we have established and used RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), a novel high-throughput sequencing
technology, to interrogate the transcriptome of the
parasitic protozoa &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/em&gt;, the agent of African sleeping sickness in man and nagana
in cattle.
In the course of this work, we have optimized the RNA-Seq protocol for use with
trypanosomatids, built our own server, implemented a stream-lined
bioinformatics pipeline and generated one of the most comprehensive genome-wide
transcript maps at single-nucleotide resolution. Such information is
central to the identification of functional elements, to determine the timing
and regulation of gene expression in different developmental stages and to
identify novel drug targets. Indeed, this work has dramatically
expanded the repertoire of known genes to include over 1,000 novel genes with
many displaying features suggesting that they are secreted or modulate the
characteristics of membranes and thus play a role in the response of &lt;em&gt;T. brucei&lt;/em&gt; to the changing environment
during its complex life cycle. We recently expanded the transcriptome studies
to developmental stages of &lt;em&gt;T. brucei&lt;/em&gt;

cycle of &lt;em&gt;Leishmania

										<li>&lt;p&gt;We develop and test the efficacy of behavioral interventions for clients with comorbid psychiatric and substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One line of research considers whether interventions targeting spending decisions by dually diagnosed clients might reduce their substance use. This question has been approached with surveys, analysis of data from quasi-experimental designs, and clinical trials. Our research has demonstrated that a high proportion of VA inpatients need money management assistance, and that expenditures for illicit drugs are not increased after benefits have been awarded. In several surveys, we have described generally high client ratings of satisfaction with a variety of involuntary payee arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In clinical trials, we have tested the efficacy of a money management-based intervention called ATM (Advisor Teller Money Manager). ATM involves a positive conception of the power of money to help clients achieve their goals and their ability to learn to manage their own affairs, as well as dampening the temptation to spend loose cash on illicit drugs and alcohol. In a recently-completed 36-week clinical trial of ATM, ATM participants had less cocaine use, reduced preference for immediate rewards (as measured by the Delayed Discounting Questionnaire), and greater likelihood of being assigned a payee compared to participants assigned to the Control intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second line of research considers interventions targeting medication non-adherence. A difficulty in counseling clients concerning the need to take prescribed medication is the difficulty in knowing when the medications were taken. In a series of studies, our group has tested the efficacy of counseling in which clients are provided electronically-generated feedback and review the dates and times medications were taken as prescribed and when they were missed. In clinical trials, we have found this counseling to be effective among clients prescribed medication for diabetes but ineffective among clients prescribed antiretroviral medication. However, review of feedback has been effective when coupled with material reinforcement, contingent on on-time bottle openings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third line of research examines the processes involved in applying for Compensation and Pension examinations. One multi-site study involves comparing a semi-structured method of conducting the Compensation and Pension evaluation of veterans being evaluated for PTSD to assessment as usual. A second study is comparing the effect of four sessions of Benefits Counseling to a control condition on engagement in work among veterans presenting for evaluation of psychiatric disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My scholarly work has two central areas of focus: one is the exploration of ethical and professional behavior in medicine, how to evaluate it, and encourage its flourishing. My goal has been to encourage residents to be aware of the personal, professional and systemic barriers to appropriate behavior, and through reflection and reaffirmation of important values and concerns, enhance their ability to meet their personal high ideals for professional behavior. The second focus of my work has been excellence in ambulatory medicine and dissemination of current, evidence-based updates for residency education and faculty development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My background in medical ethics has served me well in this setting and has allowed me to participate in fascinating and important conversations about how to support ethical and professional development not only at the student but resident level. Early in my career, I developed an interest in how to support ethical and professional behavior through attention to context and the clinical environment. As a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar, I further elucidated the nature of and factors that created ethical discomfort among medical residents in my primary fellowship project. This work has been a foundation of my ethics and professionalism teaching at Yale, and a contribution to the literature that had previously focused more on medical student ethical development and less on residency, arguably a distinct and separate stage of training. This more recent publication lead to my participation in the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation’s Project on the Hidden Curriculum. We are current analyzing qualitative data from 12 focus groups at 3 medical institutions to explore the effect of transitions on the professional development of medical trainees, as well as patient care. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My interest in articulating, establishing, and affecting the role of physicians and the pharmaceutical industry has led to my participation in two projects (including a systematic review of residency education) that have evaluated efforts to teach residents about these important issues of professional behavior. Another area of focus has been effective end-of-life communication, including development and evaluation of a new ward-based exercise for medical students, as well as seminars for the medicine residents. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of my interest in supporting resident development, I perceived a gap in information available to medicine residents each year as they began to look for jobs or fellowships. As a result, through a collaborative process, I guided the creation of Beyond Residency, an online career planning tool for Yale trainees and students which provides general information and access to additional resources on CV creation, how to search for a job, interviewing, the fellowship match process, and contract negotiation. We are also performing a controlled trial through the Yale Affiliated Hospitals to assess the effect of this resource on improving the success and decreasing stress on trainees during the application process for the step after residency. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As co-editor of the Yale Office-based Medicine Curriculum, I have the opportunity to shape an ambulatory medicine text which has broad dissemination nationally, including over 180 medicine, family medicine residencies, nursing, and physician assistant programs. With my co-editors Seonaid Hay and Laura Whitman, we take suggestions from our residents and faculty on topics and important clinical questions that help shape our case-based chapters. Our overall curricular structure covers core subjects in ambulatory medicine, while allowing tailoring to current important developments, including new therapies (such as inhaled insulin) or policy issues (such as the Vioxx or Avandia controversies). At many institutions our curriculum is used for a faculty-guided small group discussion, which allows us terrific opportunities for faculty development and influence, as well promoting Yale’s standard of excellence in up-to-date and high quality ambulatory medicine nationally. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In summary, my current position allows for a breadth of opportunity to teach and improve moral sensitivity, critical thinking, and, hopefully, professional behavior. In the future, I would hope to continue to delineate factors that support ethical and professional behavior and determine which most effectively protect trainees from some of the deleterious effects of the so-called hidden curriculum of medical training, with attention to such areas as pharmaceutical relations and end-of-life care. I hope to also continue to move the Yale Office-based Medicine to a new threshold as a high quality, comprehensive tool for ambulatory education while also seeking to enhance the evaluation of the Curriculum as a strategy for demonstrating an effective way to improve resident knowledge, skills, and behavior regarding ambulatory medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

Mutations in mtDNA cause maternally inherited neuromuscular disorders due to declines in cellular energy metabolism.

										<li>&lt;strong&gt;History

development of the target theory. The detailed history of the origins

&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;History of the Manchurian Plague, 1910-1911&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beginning in October 1910,
a major epidemic of pneumonic plague swept through Manchuria and by the
spring of 1911 had killed between 45,000-60,000 people. The plague and
its aftermath were to play an important role in the geopolitical events
leading up to the Japanese takeover of Manchuria and complex causes of
World War II. The concentrated force of this epidemic, its near 100
percent mortality rate, and its occurrence in a region of international
competition and diplomatic struggle all contributed to the importance
and interest in the Manchurian plague. The &quot;Manchurian Question&quot; was of
immense interest in the United States: America had just enjoyed its
first taste of successful international leadership upon Roosevelt&#39;s
brokering the peace treaty of 1905 that ended the Russo-Japanese war
over territorial rights in Manchuria. Russia, on the other hand was
intent on retaining what she could of her centuries-old foothold in
east Asia. Japan, modernizing after the Meiji restoration in 1868, was
experiencing international ambitions and expansionism in Korea and
Manchuria, in its own version of &quot;manifest destiny.&quot; China, under the
yoke of war reparations owed to both the Western Powers and to Japan as
the result of the ill- fated Boxer Rebellion in 1895, was struggling
with its first efforts at modernization while still governed by the
decaying, and increasingly ineffective Qing dynasty. This project aims
to elucidate the multiple uses which was made of the plague to exhibit
the importance of epidemic disease in geopolitics.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;The cilium is a hair like cell surface organelle that is almost ubiquitously present on vertebrate cells. It is believed to function as an antenna for the cell to detect and transduce signals. Not surprisingly, in the past decade, there is an increasing appreciation for the vital role played by this tiny organelle in diverse developmental processes and homeostasis in vertebrates. Consistently, cilia dysgenesis and dysfunction have been linked to a growing list of human diseases ranging from polycystic kidney disease (PKD), cancer, to mental retardation and obesity, collectively referred to as ciliopathies. However, the cilium is also one of the few organelles whose physiology and function remain to be fully interrogated. Despite the amazing structural conservation of this organelle from green algae to human, the function of the cilium has diverged significantly between vertebrates and traditional invertebrate model organisms, including &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to fly and worm, zebrafish shows significant functional conservation of cilia-mediated signaling with mammals. Combined with its amenability to large-scale chemical and genetic screens, the accessibility of cilia in multiple organs and the collection of cilia mutants already available, this feature of zebrafish makes it uniquely positioned as a model system for studying cilia and ciliopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a variety of approaches in zebrafish, we are teasing out the mechanisms that govern cilia biogenesis, motility and size and the role of cilia in development and diseases. One disease of particular interest is polycystic kidney disease (PKD). PKD is characterized by the formation of multiple kidney cysts thought to result from over-proliferation of renal epithelial cells. Understanding PKD is of profound medical importance. Striking one in 1000 live births, autosomal dominant form of PKD (ADPKD) is among the most common monogenetic disorders in humans. Aside from kidney transplantation, no directed treatment is available for this disease. Our studies have provided strong evidence for the critical role of the cilium in PKD pathogenesis and suggested HDAC inhibitors as promising candidate drugs for treating PKD. We are expanding our research into the role of cilia in other diseases and are also developing novel tools for studying PKD and cilia in zebrafish.&lt;/p&gt;

My research is aimed at: 1. improving the efficacy of opioid
agonist maintenance treatment through investigations of alternatives to
methadone for maintenance treatment (e.g., buprenorphine), investigations of
adjunctive behavioral (e.g., behavioral drug and HIV risk reduction counseling,
BDRC) and pharmacological (e.g., disulfiram) treatments, and developing
integrated treatments for co-occurring disorders (co-occurring stimulant abuse
or co-occurring chronic pain) for opioid dependent individuals; 2. improving
the accessibility and effectiveness of opioid dependence treatment by
integrating it in office-based and primary care settings; and 3. expanding
opioid dependence treatment and clinical research in international settings
(with current projects in Malaysia,
Iran, and China).  My work on buprenorphine maintenance
treatment illustrates the progression of my research.  My initial work focused on comparing the
efficacy of buprenorphine and methadone for patients with co-occurring cocaine
and opioid dependence.  Subsequent
studies evaluated adjunctive behavioral and pharmacological treatments to
improve the effectiveness of buprenorphine maintenance treatment for patients
with co-occurring cocaine and opioid dependence and also investigated the
effectiveness of buprenorphine maintenance treatment in office-based and
primary care settings and strategies for improving its effectiveness in those
settings.  The studies in office-based
and primary care settings, the high prevalence and adverse consequences of
chronic pain among opioid dependent patients treated in primary care settings,
and the potential advantages of using buprenorphine to treat co-occurring
chronic pain and opioid dependence (POD) in these settings led to our current
studies aimed at evaluating buprenorphine for POD and at evaluating integrated
behavioral treatments for POD.  Our
studies in primary care settings and physician offices also led to our research
aimed at interventions for and treatment of cocaine dependent women identified
in prenatal clinics and to our current studies of buprenorphine maintenance
treatment in Iran, Malaysia, and China.

										<li>Adequate body fluid and cardiovascular regulation are essential to respond to environmental challenges.  Over my first seven years at Yale we demonstrated that estradiol, with and without progesterone, alters the osmotic regulation of arginine vasopressnin (AVP).  Moreover, my laboratory has shown under a variety conditions and within both aging and younger populations that this is a change in osmotic set point for the control of AVP.  We came to this conclusion because there is little change in renal free water clearance, the primary fluid regulation variable controlled by AVP.  In addition we demonstrated that estradiol and progesterone not only affect osmotic regulation of AVP, but also affect body fluid distribution across the compartments (interstitial, intra- and extra-cellular, plasma) and may have important implications for the development of edema in women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most importantly, in order to deal with challenges associated with studying reproductive hormone effects on physiological systems, we developed a model to study effects of reproductive hormones on physiological systems in young women.  In this model we “medically oophorectomize” young women by transiently suppressing gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) with an agonist (leuprolide acetate) or antagonist (ganirelix acetate).  Both of these drugs suppress GnRH and therefore suppress both estrogens and progesterone.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the women are suppressed, we add-back controlled levels of estradiol and progesterone to test the hypothesis of interest.  This protocol is particularly useful because it isolates estradiol effects from those of progesterone in young women.  Other methods of studying estradiol effects in young women (such as pregnancy, oral contraceptives, menstrual cycle phase) can only indirectly infer estradiol-related effects because other physiological changes are taking place simultaneously.  This model provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect of the chosen sex hormone on a variety of system.			 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our research continues to examine the effects of reproductive hormones (now including testosterone) on thermoregulation and fluid regulation in young, healthy women and in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).  We have recently demonstrated that combined sodium loss with water retention is a characteristic of women at risk for Exercise Associated Hyponatremia (EAH).  These studies have demonstrated that in women at risk for this potentially fatal syndrome, the primary cause of EAH is more closely related to overall fluid retention concomitant with sodium losses.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our studies have also demonstrated that obese women with PCOS have compromised thermoregulation compared to their healthy obese counterparts, which may be related to their consistent elevations in testosterone.			 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My current grant addresses the impact of female reproductive hormones on blood pressure regulation in women at risk for orthostatic intolerance.  Regularly occurring orthostatic intolerance can be debilitating and is much more common in young women relative to men, children or older women.  Our studies will determine the roles of estradiol and progesterone in this syndrome, and will also explore the peripheral mechanisms involved.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To study mechanisms related to orthostatic intolerance in young women we use microneurography to examine the extent to which sympathetic nervous system activity mediates sex hormone effects on orthostatic tolerance, and laser Doppler flowmetry combined with skin microdialysis to examine mechanisms controlling the peripheral circulation.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our recent studies have demonstrated that adrenergic responses are shifted to the right in women with low orthostatic tolerance, suggested reduced vasoconstriction in response to adrenergic stimulation compared to women with high orthostatic tolerance.  Moreover our studies have demonstrated that progesterone enhances vasoconstriction in response to adrenergic stimulation only in women with high orthostatic tolerance.  We are just beginning studies examining endothelial function in the skin microvasculature in women with PCOS.

										<li>My research effort in biological physics employs both theoretical and computational approaches, including statistical mechanics descriptions
and coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, to study
important biological problems ranging from determining the
mechanical properties of skin cancer cells to understanding protein
misfolding and aggregation.  All of the projects described below involve close collaborations with experimental biologists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Smart, designer, protein-based nanogels: &lt;/strong&gt;We design, create, and characterize new classes of
stimuli-responsive biomaterials. A distinguishing feature of these
materials is the incorporation of tetratricopeptide (TPR) modules of
defined structure and stability and cross-linkers between TPRs to
create a scaffold with structural integrity. Cross-linking in these
novel materials is governed by specific TPR-peptide
interactions. We are able to design and manipulate the
microscopic components and their interactions with unprecedented
control in these materials. We combine experimental measurements
with coarse-grained computer simulations to understand and define the
macroscopic consequences of particular designs.  This coordinated process will lead to a new generation of
active biomaterials with unprecedented, highly-specific molecular
recognition capabilities and response to external stimuli.  Collaborators
on this project include Profs. Eric Dufresne (Mechanical Engineering, 
Chemical Engineering, Cell Biology, and Physics) and Lynne Regan (Molecular Biophysics &amp; Biochemistry, Chemistry).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Understanding the structural and mechanical properties of epithelial cells: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The goal of this project is to first determine the structural
properties (cell size and shape) and mechanical constraints
(intercellular forces and packing geometry) of normal epithelial
tissue and then identify how these properties evolve during cancer
progression and wound healing. This work is based on the hypothesis that tumor&lt;br&gt;
formation and cell motion during wound healing can be directly linked
to changes in the mechanical properties of the tissue.   We will address three
fundamental open questions in this project: 1) Does the structure,
packing geometry, and force-bearing properties of cells and tissues
change during tumorigenesis? 2) Is there a feedback effect, in which
these changes promote the progression of tumorigenesis? and 3) To what extent can wound healing be modeled by mechanical response without biochemical signaling? 
Collaborators on this project include Profs. Eric Dufresne (Mechanical Engineering &amp; Materials Science, 
Chemical Engineering, Cell Biology) and Valerie
Horsley (MCDB).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Nanoscale approaches to screening small molecule inhibitors of 
toxic amyloid species in neurodegenerative disease: &lt;/strong&gt;Single molecule measurements are uniquely capable of characterizing
the dynamic set of molecular species that are populated during amyloid
aggregation. We will combine experimental single molecule
fluorescence methods with computer simulations to develop a novel
approach to determine how soluble amyloid species interact with small
organic molecules. We will develop our methods using the Parkinson&#39;s
Disease associated protein, alpha-synuclein, and the Alzheimer&#39;s
Disease associated protein, tau. Using small molecules that have been
identified for their ability to perturb aggregation of these proteins, we will study their effects on protein conformational dynamics and
oligomerization process.  We will specifically address two questions: (1) how do small molecules affect monomer structures and
their dynamics and (2) what is the effect of small molecules on
oligomerization. The results of these investigations will provide an
ultrasensitive, robust assay for screening small molecules that
perturb soluble pre-fibrillar amyloid species. Thus, if successful,&lt;br&gt;
our proposed research will lead to a transformative change in the way
small-molecule drugs are screened, the ultimate outcome of which is
the development of drugs to treat or prevent Parkinson&#39;s, Alzheimer&#39;s,
and other amyloid diseases.  This work will be performed 
in collaboration with Prof. Elizabeth Rhoades (MB&amp;B, Physics).

										<li>There is increasing interest in the development of workplace preventive interventions as a means of reaching large segments of the adult population to address the potentially adverse effects of work, family, work-family, and other stressors. The spectrum of documented stress-related problems among workers is extensive, ranging from psychological symptoms, including depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints to substance abuse to physical health problems such as heart disease, hypertension, and obesity. These problems are costly to employers, employees and their families as well as to society at large. It is estimated that in the workplace, billions of dollars are lost each year in diminished productivity, high rates of absenteeism, and reduced performance resulting from these types of stress-related problems.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Yale Work and Family Stress Program was initially established through two grants funded by NIDA and NIAAA (David L. Snow, PI). Based on a risk and protective factor model, these investigations assessed whether an intervention, Coping with Work and Family Stress, aimed at increasing individuals’ use of active coping strategies and social support, reducing stressors and avoidance coping, and enhancing effective stress management approaches led to the prevention or reduction of alcohol and drug use and psychological symptoms. Essential components of the research included: 1) identifying risk and protective factors that are predictive of substance use and psychological symptoms and that can be targeted in subsequent interventions; and 2) assessing the effectiveness of randomized controlled interventions implemented in the workplace. Significant effects of these efficacy trials have been shown in reducing work, family, and work-family stressors, increasing social support from supervisors and coworkers, enhancing the use active coping and decreasing the use of avoidance coping strategies, and in reducing alcohol consumption, smoking and other substance use, and psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatic complaints. Based on these research findings, Coping with Work and Family Stress was designated by SAMHSA in 2003 as a Model Prevention Program and, more recently (2007), was listed as an evidence-based program by the National Registry of Effective Programs and Practices (NREPP). Building on this phase of research, effectiveness trials are currently underway with new populations and settings, most notably with medical residents in training at university medical schools. In addition to this ongoing research, the program is now in a stage of active dissemination nationally and internationally. Future intervention research will involve: (1) efforts to change risk and protective factors at multiple levels of the organization (individual employee, work group or department, overall organization) in order to achieve even greater effect sizes, (2) to test the efficacy of modified, but related, interventions designed specifically for family caregivers in the workplace, in one instance, and, in another, for women in community settings at risk for HIV/AIDS and substance abuse disorders, (3) to disseminate science-based workplace interventions to military personnel and their families; and 4) to collaborate on a study of the effects of changes in Time and Place Management (TPM) policies (i.e. workplace flexibility) on employee health, well being, and productivity in a large U.S. corporation

										<li>Our research is focused on development of novel medications for cocaine and nicotine dependence. Our program seeks to bridge the gap between human laboratory studies examining the medical safety and potential efficacy of new medications for substance dependence and outpatient trials directly examining these medications in drug relapse. Among the key findings is our work on sex and menstrual cycle influences on cocaine responses in humans. To explain our novel observations on sex and menstrual cycle effects on cocaine responses, we proposed progesterone’s role as a modulator of cocaine effects. We tested this hypothesis with a series of systematic human studies ranging from human laboratory to clinical trials examining the potential utility of progesterone as a treatment for cocaine and nicotine addiction. Following those seminal contributions, progesterone is considered a key modulator of drug use behavior, and an active area of research at the international level. Similarly, we were among the first to examine the contribution of the adrenergic system in cocaine responses with novel findings for effects of an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker, carvedilol. These novel human laboratory findings led to a new potential treatment approach using carvedilol for cocaine as well as methamphetamine addiction that is being pursued by other research research groups.  More recently, we have developed a novel intravenous nicotine self-administration model which allows examination of both rewarding and aversive effects of nicotine in male and female smokers. This model has a great utility for early human screening for potential medications for tobacco addiction. We are currently using this model to test potential GABA medications for tobacco addiction and to determine the genetic moderators of nicotine&#39;s rewarding and cognitive-enhancing effects.

We investigate the early steps in the assembly of the cytokinetic contractile ring, so we study the structures and functions of the proteins that organize the precursors of the contractile ring, including anillin, myosin-II, a formin, an IQGAP and an F-BAR protein. Anillin and IQGAPs appear to be adapter proteins that form a scaffold for the other proteins. Formins grow actin filaments while remaining attached to the end
of the elongating polymer. Myosin-II pulls together the precurors of the contractile ring and later constricts the contractile ring to pinch the daughter cells in two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We use computer simulations of mathematical models to compare our ideas regarding mechanisms with observations in live cells.&lt;br&gt;

										<li>My research laboratory seeks to understand the basic biology of a novel population of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPC) derived from heart tissues and embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. These CPC are capable of making nearly an entire heart during heart formation and are marked by Isl1, a LIM-Homeo domain transcription factor. Through a high-throughput small molecule screen coupled with murine ES cell and embryonic heart developmental studies, we have successfully discovered several small molecules modulating these CPC. One of our major goals is to further dissect the mechanisms governing the biology of these CPC. We believe that knowledge from these studies will enable us to enhance activities of adult CPC in the injured heart in vivo to ameliorate heart diseases. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adult stem cells may undergo aging, possibly affecting their ability to maintain organ homeostasis. Therefore, our second research project is to obtain functional CPC and cardiomyocytes from human ES and iPS cells for cell-based therapy. In collaboration with Dr. Christopher Breuer’s laboratory at Yale, we will utilize bio-degradable scaffold to establish engineered heart tissues (EHT) with CPC and examine their contribution to heart repair and regeneration in animal models. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With purified CPC and cardiomyocytes from human ES and iPS, our third research project is to establish an in vitro cellular model to study human heart development and disease mechanisms by investigating the effect of genetic alterations on the functions of CPC and cardiomyocytes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, we would like to take advantage of our previous experience in high-throughput small molecule screening to establish assays for new chemical screens to directly reprogram heart fibroblast (scar-forming cells) and quiescent adult epicardial cells into CPC, essential for heart repair and regeneration. By modulating adult resident CPC directly in vivo, and exploring cell-based therapy coupled with tissue engineering in vitro, we believe that our lab represents an exciting time on the forefront of heart repair and regeneration studies. We wholeheartedly welcome you to join our team and contribute to such exciting endeavors.

A battery of the most advanced methods are used with the hope of gaining insight into epigenetic sequences and the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the development and evolution of the primate brain<ins class='diffins'>.The cerebral cortex provides the biological substrate for human cognitive capacity and is, arguably, the part of the brain that distinguishes us from other species</ins>.<ins class='diffins'> Therefore, understanding the evolution and development of this complex structure is central to our understanding of human intelligence, creativity and disorders of the highest cognitive functions. However, in our enthusiasm for universality of biological principles and a conservation of the genomic sequence, we sometimes forget that the heterogeneity among species is higher than expected from their genomic similarity. Even a small difference in the timing, sequence and level of gene expression may influence the phenotype in a major way. It seems obvious that one cannot understand specific human characteristics by looking only at a mouse model that does not possess these traits or have traits that have been lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have new evidence that the species-specific size and characteristics of the cerebral neocortex are already detectable in the embryonic human forebrain before the onset of cortico-neurogenesis, but these early stages are not understood. Thirty-five years ago, the Boulder Committee recommended a blueprint and nomenclature for the development of the mammalian central nervous system, based on the model proposed by the applicant of this proposed grant. This model has been reproduced directly or in a modified form, in virtually every textbook of neuroembryology and the neurosciences, in general. However, the introduction of advanced methods and new concepts in developmental biology now necessitates an update of this basic schema.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The primary objective of the proposed research is to enhance our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal production, migration and positioning during early development of the cerebral cortex directly in humans. We propose to focus on the initial specification and cascade processes that establish the morphological and functional diversity of neurogenesis in the embryonic human telencephalon. We have recently obtained novel and unexpected evidence that the embryonic human telencephalic primordium, before the onset of local corticogenesis, contains a hitherto unrecognized transient population of neuronal cells. These &quot;predecessor&quot; cortical stem cells (new word!), are situated above the proliferative ventricular zone of the human telencephalon at the 4th week of gestation. We propose a radical idea that these neuronal stem cells are not homogeneous, but rather are already different amongst themselves. Furthermore, we speculate that these cells might initiate the cascade of developmental events leading to the formation of the cerebral cortex, which commences in human only about two weeks later. I am proposing that we try not only to characterize these new types of neural stem cells, but also to isolate and immortalize them with the most advanced methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Composite analyses of the gene expression patterns that we are going to perform will allow us to characterize the molecularly distinct progenitor domains in the forebrain primordium and to elucidate the genetic interactions underlying the early regionalization of the telencephalon directly in humans. We have unpublished evidence, which if elaborated, could alter one of the main concepts in the field of developmental neurobiology; namely, that the first neurons in the primordium of the human cerebral cortex (preplate zone) are generated outside of the developing cortex. To confirm these results, we are going to first perform modern cell-tracing experiments in slice culture preparations as well as immunohistochemical analysis to uncover the pattern of migration, connectivity and the role(s) of the pioneer neurons in the human telencephalon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a second step, dividing cells situated on the surface of the ex vivo human telencephalic vesicle obtained by legal abortion will be transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing fluorescent marker (GFP) under the control of the retroviral promoter. We will make shallow injections under the pial surface and after a brief recovery period, cells will be dissociated, single GFP expressing cells isolated, expanded with appropriate growth factors and then cryopreserved as cell aggregates. To produce stable clonal cell lines, cells will be infected with a retroviral vector expressing the v-myc fusion protein, propagated and characterized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The project is designed to combine the expertise and unique experience in human brain development in my group at Yale, USA (including A. Ayoub and K. Hashimoto-Torii), C. Blakemore’s group at Oxford, UK (including I. Bystron and S. Lindsay) and V. Otellin’s group (Institute of Experimental Medicine, St. Petersburg, Russia). My laboratory has applied several new approaches in human brain tissue that involve a combination of organotypic culture and viral transduction to study the molecular mechanisms of cortical development (2); the Oxford group will provide expertise in the characterization of human neuronal cell lines (e.g. Bystron at al, 2005) and in vivo transplantation assays, and the St. Petersburg group has access to fresh embryonic brain tissue from legally performed interruption of pregnancies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The emphasis on the early aspects of neuronal production, migration and positioning in human brain development will provide new insight into molecular evolution as well as in the pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric disorders which affect millions of people of all ages which severely impacts the national economy. This information can only be obtained by studying early human forebrain neural stem cells.  </ins>

										<li>&lt;strong&gt;Functional MR imaging&lt;/strong&gt; is an objective method of studying the subjective effects of anesthesia.  It is an imaging tool being used widely by neuroscientist for objectively studying functional activities in the CNS like speech, movement, visual / auditory activation, memory etc.  With fMRI we can measure BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent contrast) a qualitative measure of cerebral metabolism and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).  BOLD and rCBF are indirect measures of neuronal activity.  Our aim in our fMRI anesthesia studies is to extend the utility of fMRI imaging tool for improving our understanding of the central effects of anesthesia.  These studies have been in progress since 2003.  In collaboration with the MRRC (magnetic resonance research center) we have been studying healthy ASA I volunteers under sevoflurane anesthesia.  We have studied the central effects of sevoflurane anesthesia (0.5% and 1% sevoflurane equivalent to 0.25 MAC and 0.5 MAC) as well as the effect of functional activation under anesthesia.  So far 60 subjects have been imaged. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)    In our first protocol the effect of visual, auditory and motor activation was studied under 0.25 MAC sevoflurane.  Cerebral metabolism (BOLD) as well as rCBF was measured.  Our conclusion from this study was – higher order association regions (like hippocampus, thalamus and cingulate gyrus) since they receive their input from multisynaptic pathways are much more sensitive to 0.25 MAC sevoflurane compared to the unimodal association areas.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2)    Subsequently we studied the effect 0.25 and 0.5 MAC sevoflurane on auditory activation and memory activation.   0.25 MAC sevoflurane attenuated activation of the auditory cortex while 0.5 MAC sevoflurane exerted profound effects on the auditory cortex.  This is of clinical relevance because auditory activation closely correlates with midlatency auditory evoked response which in turn correlates with amnesia under anesthesia.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3)    When memory was activated (subjects heard a story presented over the headphones) both levels of sevoflurane anesthesia profoundly decreased the memory score in the subjects.  fMRI imaging revealed decrease in activity in the thalamus and pre frontal cortex.  However activation of the hippocampus persisted at 0.5 MAC sevoflurane. Clinically all the subjects were asleep and had no memory of any events at 0.5 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4)    The effect of 0.5 MAC sevoflurane on functional activity was studied with BOLD imaging.  Low frequency oscillations in BOLD signals were compared in the awake and anesthesia state.  Though subjects were asleep connectivity persisted in the thalamus at 0.5 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are presently studying the effect of somatosensory and auditory activation under 0.5 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia.  We propose to study the effect of Propofol and Remifentanil in the future.

										<li>The emphasis of our research is being placed upon the following: (a) the most intense research ongoing in the laboratory involves the design of a new class of antineoplastic agents, the 1,2-bis(sulfonyl)hydrazines that function as alkylating agent prodrugs which target the O-6 position of guanine in DNA (a prodrug is an inactive form, which can be converted by neoplastic cells to an active therapeutic form). This research has led to the development of two prototype agents that following activation generate a second reactive species, 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine, abbreviated 90CE, with broad spectrum potent activity against transplanted murine and human tumors.  The first series of synthetic compounds yielding a clinical candidate were 2-aminocarbonyl-1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazines which undergo activation by base catalyzed decomposition to yield 90CE.  The selected candidate agent, onrigin™ (formally called cloretazine), which chloroethylates the O-6 position of guanine in DNA and ultimately forms DNA G-C cross-links, has shown considerable activity in elderly patients with poor risk de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) for which no standard therapy is available.  Onrigin as a single agent has produced an objective response rate (CR, complete remission + CRp, all of the criteria for a CR with platelets less than 100,000/&#181;l) of 34% these patients, with modest systemic toxicity.&lt;br&gt;    A second group of 1,2-bis(sulfonyl)hydraznes that generates 90CE is exemplified by 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-2-[[(1-4-nitrophenyl)ethoxy]carbonyl]hydrazine (KS119), which undergoes a different activation mechanism (bioreduction) to generate 90CE; this agent and several analogs thereof have been developed in our laboratory to target the reductive enzymatic potential of hypoxic regions within solid tumors.  We have pioneered the concept, introduced in the early 1970’s, that hypoxic areas in tumors are sites of vulnerability in that the environment of these cells promotes selective reductive activation directly in solid tumors, creating an exploitable difference between normal cells in body tissues, which are usually well oxygenated, and hypoxic neoplastic cells.  We have developed several lead prodrug compounds that selectively generate cytotoxic products that destroy hypoxic tumor cells, which are usually quite resistant to therapeutic intervention, as well as employing the hypoxic fraction to generate agents that circumvent the major resistance mechanism to agents targeting the O-6 position of guanine in DNA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b.    O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-Alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), a repair protein that catalyzes the transfer of both alkyl and methyl groups from the O-6 position of DNA guanine generated from chloroethylating agents such as onrigin, KS119, and carmustine (BCNU), as well as temozolomide and other tumor methylating agents to cysteine 145 of the AGT molecule, thereby inactivating AGT and restoring the O-6 position of guanine to its native form.  This action results in tumor reistance to the chloroethylating and methylating agents described above and, in experimental systems, a direct relationship exists between AGT activity and the degree of resistance to O-6 guanine targeting agents.  AGT is also present in varying amounts in normal tissue, thereby protecting normal tissue to agents such as onrigin; however, the concentration of AGT in tumors often is significantly higher than in corresponding normal tissue.  &lt;br&gt;    One of the most potent known inhibitors of AGT is O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-benzylguanine (O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-BG); this agent reacts with AGT to form S-benzylcysteine in the active site of the protein.  As a result, O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-BG depletes AGT and increases the sensitivity of tumor and host cells to agents that chloroethylate the O-6 position of DNA guanine and ultimately produce lethal DNA G-C cross-links.  Non-toxic doses of systemic O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-BG have been shown in patients to deplete the AGT content of tumors and enhance the antineoplastic action of the nitrosourea carmustine.  A similar depletion of AGT in normal tissue is produced by O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-BG; this action also sensitizes host tissue to the cytodestructive action of carmustine, necessitating an 80% decrease in the dose of carmustine because of excessive myelosuppression.  The large decrease in the dosage of the nitrosourea results in an ineffective level of carmustine.  To circumvent this problem, we are currently designing prodrug inhibitors of AGT activated by the reductive potential of hypoxic tumor cells in an effort to selectively deplete AGT in solid tumors relative to normal tissue, such that sensitivity to O-6 DNA guanine targeting agents will be selectively cytotoxic to solid tumors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c.    An additional series of agents that we have developed is exemplified by the potential drug, triapine, the most potent known inhibitor of the important enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR); triapine has also shown clinical activity against acute myelogenous leukemia.  RNR catalyzes a rate-limiting reaction in which ribonucleoside diphosphates are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, the precursors of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) required for DNA synthesis and repair.  Mammalian RNR consists of two non-identical homodimers, R1 and either R2 or p53R2, which are considered to be involved in DNA replication and repair, respectively.  The R2 subunit of RNR maintains dNTP pools for DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle and p53R2 supplies dNTPs for DNA repair when DNA damage occurs.  Since 50% of human cancers contain mutated or deleted p53 it was not clear how malignant cells that lacked inducible p53R2 supplied sufficient dNTPs for DNA repair.  To study this issue, we employed HCT-116 p53(-/-) cells which we developed from p53(+/+) HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells and demonstrated an accumulation of the R2 protein in these cells in response to triapine, cisplatin and doxorubicin.  R2-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to decrease the level of the R2 protein and caused a marked increase in sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin, as well as to the RNR inhibitor triapine.  These findings and others provided evidence that R2-RNR was capable of supplying dNTPs for the repair of DNA damage in p53 deficient tumor cells.  We are currently studying the role of the S phase checkpoint in facilitating DNA damage repair by R2-RNR in p53 deficient ovarian carcinoma cells damaged by cisplatin and other platinum-containing drugs, as well as by triapine, which preferentially depletes dATP levels.  The mechanism involved in the preferential depletion of dATP is currently unknown.

AGT is also present in varying amounts in normal tissue, thereby protecting normal tissue to agents such as onrigin; however, the concentration of AGT in tumors often is significantly higher than in corresponding normal tissue.  &lt;br&gt;    One of the most potent known inhibitors of AGT is O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-benzylguanine (O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-BG); this agent reacts with AGT to form S-benzylcysteine in the active site of the protein.  As a result, O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-BG depletes AGT and increases the sensitivity of tumor and host cells to agents that chloroethylate the O-6 position of DNA guanine and ultimately produce lethal DNA G-C cross-links.  Non-toxic doses of systemic O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-BG have been shown in patients to deplete the AGT content of tumors and enhance the antineoplastic action of the nitrosourea carmustine.  A similar depletion of AGT in normal tissue is produced by O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-BG; this action also sensitizes host tissue to the cytodestructive action of carmustine, necessitating an 80% decrease in the dose of carmustine because of excessive myelosuppression.  The large decrease in the dosage of the nitrosourea results in an ineffective level of carmustine.  To circumvent this problem, we are currently designing prodrug inhibitors of AGT activated by the reductive potential of hypoxic tumor cells in an effort to selectively deplete AGT in solid tumors relative to normal tissue, such that sensitivity to O-6 DNA guanine targeting agents will be selectively cytotoxic to solid tumors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c.    An additional series of agents that we have developed is exemplified by the potential drug, triapine, the most potent known inhibitor of the important enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR); triapine has also shown clinical activity against acute myelogenous leukemia.  RNR catalyzes a rate-limiting reaction in which ribonucleoside diphosphates are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, the precursors of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) required for DNA synthesis and repair.  Mammalian RNR consists of two non-identical homodimers, R1 and either R2 or p53R2, which are considered to be involved in DNA replication and repair, respectively.  The R2 subunit of RNR maintains dNTP pools for DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle and p53R2 supplies dNTPs for DNA repair when DNA damage occurs.  Since 50% of human cancers contain mutated or deleted p53 it was not clear how malignant cells that lacked inducible p53R2 supplied sufficient dNTPs for DNA repair.  To study this issue, we employed HCT-116 p53(-/-) cells which we developed from p53(+/+) HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells and demonstrated an accumulation of the R2 protein in these cells in response to triapine, cisplatin and doxorubicin.  R2-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to decrease the level of the R2 protein and caused a marked increase in sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin, as well as to the RNR inhibitor triapine.  These findings and others provided evidence that R2-RNR was capable of supplying dNTPs for the repair of DNA damage in p53 deficient tumor cells.  We are currently studying the role of the S phase checkpoint in facilitating DNA damage repair by R2-RNR in p53 deficient ovarian carcinoma cells damaged by cisplatin and other platinum-containing drugs, as well as by triapine, which preferentially depletes dATP levels.  The mechanism involved in the preferential depletion of dATP is currently unknown<ins class='diffins'>.Current projects we are working on are: &lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomedical Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays a central role in retinal physiology by forming the outer blood-retinal barrier and supporting the function of the photoreceptors. Many retinopathies involve a disruption of the epithelium&#39;s interactions with the neural retina or its uncontrolled proliferation. Surgical interventions limit the progression of disease, but fail to restore function. Although encouraging progress has been made with RPE transplantation, its effectiveness is limited to the earliest stages of disease when patients would be reluctant to have surgery.  Our goal is to expand that window of opportunity by understanding the interactions of the RPE with its neighbors, the choroid and the neural portion of the retina. Our early studies with chick RPE demonstrated that: 1) As the neural retina matures, it secretes factors that induce the RPE to form the outer blood-retinal barrier by decreasing the permeability of RPE junctions. 2) At the RPE/neural retina interface, extracellular matrix or cell-cell interactions regulate the distribution of certain integrins. These integrins are redistributed when the neural retina and its extracellular matrix mature. 3) Initially, diffusible factors produced by the neural retina maintain the apical polarity of the Na,K-ATPase. These retinal factors differ from those that decrease the permeability of the monolayer, and may act indirectly through effects on the structure of the apical microvilli. 4) Gene array studies demonstrate that 40% of the RPE transcriptome changes in parallel with retinal development.  Retinal secretions regulate many of these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current research asks whether the chick studies are relevant to human biology. Surprisingly, we found that the tight junctions of human RPE differ significantly from those of non-primate vertebrates -- surprising because tight junctions serve a conserved function. Tight junctions are an integral part of any blood-tissue barrier, because they regulate diffusion across the paracellular spaces of an epithelial monolayer. Tight junctions form a network of anastomosing strands that encircles each cell and binds it to its neighbors in the monolayer. They regulate the permeability and selectivity of the paracellular path and are matched with the ion channels and transporters that regulate the transcellular movement of solutes. Claudins are a family of at least 24 proteins that determine the properties of tight junctions and each epithelium expresses a subset that reflects the physiology of the organ. Human RPE expresses a different set of claudins that non-primate vertebrates which implies differences in retinal physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cultures of human fetal RPE (hfRPE) and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived RPE, we found that we could make the barrier function more in vivo-like by using a serum free medium that we call SFM-1. Studies of the transcriptome demonstrate that SFM-1 affects many genes and that adaptation of the cultures to SFM-1 furthers the maturation of hESC-RPE.  This was demonstrated in two cells, H1 and H9. Examining function and the transcriptome leads us to believe that even after SFM-1, hESC-RPE remains less mature than hfRPE isolated from 16 week-gestation fetal eyes.  The study identifies 25 marker genes that can be used to monitor the maturation of RPE that we predict will occur when hESC-RPE is co-cultured with hESC-derived retinal precursors (RPC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, RPE and RPC need to be culture in the same media.  It appears that SFM-1 furthers the maturation of RPC so that co-culture is feasible.  We have found that a woven scaffold of polycaprolactone provides a way to culture RPC as a flat sheet that can be layered atop a sheet of RPE.  Preliminary data indicate that gene expression is altered in both the RPE and RPC layers following co-culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this co-culture model will provide a superior platform to explore the efficacy of drugs that might treat retinal degenerations or improve the efficacy of transplantation. Further, the model itself may prove to be a suitable tissue for transplantation into patients with advanced retinal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educational Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The international community of medical educators struggles with how to decompress an overcrowded curriculum. The questions have become what to teach, when to teach it and how to teach it in less time. The problem is especially acute for anatomy. Even though the classical anatomy course is a large component of medical school, residency programs believe their residents come ill-prepared. Further, the pool of qualified instructors is shrinking. To address these issues of content, efficiency and instructors, I investigated what students need, how they learn and how instructors teach.  I call the resulting method “Clinically-Engaged Anatomy”. Clinically-engaged anatomy engages students in professional behaviors to learn the anatomy that prepares them for clerkships. Students learn how to draw inferences from skillful observation to form testable hypotheses, test them and teach others about the process.  The coursework requires students to develop the teamwork skills that characterize modern medical practice.  The clinical cases that drive the curriculum are cases commonly encountered in Yale affiliated hospitals. Students study the anatomy that underlies the patient’s history, physical exam, imaging studies and medical or surgical resolution.  The cadaver becomes a simulated patient whereby anatomy is explored by performing surgical procedures.  This approach fosters integration of anatomy with clinical training and has attracted large numbers of clinic faculty to participate.  Despite a 30% reduction in course hours, we demonstrated that students recall more when they enter clerkships.  Clinically-engaged anatomy merges advanced web resources with laboratory dissection. My “Anatomy Clinic” website attracts more than 17,000 non-Yale page viewings per year from around the world and is used in Great Britain for their “Basic Training Programme for Anatomy Professionals”. The anesthesiology and otolaryngology residency training programs adapted these methods to their laboratory sessions. Therefore, clinically engaged anatomy has identified important anatomy to teach, conveys that knowledge effectively in less time, and attracts a large number of faculty who would not participate in the old course. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Current research asks how to train the next generation of anatomy instructors.  Very few training programs remain for anatomists.  Most institutions require instructors to maintain competitive biomedical research programs, which means mastering a discipline that is unrelated to anatomy. The goal is to develop a training program for upper-tier postdoctoral fellows that has minimal impact on their biomedical research training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second project investigates how clinical students incorporate interactive computer activities into their daily work and how that information might guide curricular development.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Research Focus: The interests of my laboratory center around investigations of signaling pathways stimulated following endothelial cell-cell and endothelial cell-extracellular interactions and how they influence the processes of Vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and transendothelial migration.&lt;br /&gt;Endothelial cells play central roles in the development, growth and maintenance of the vascular system as well as in the processes of inflammation, repair and metastasis. Vascular cell homotypic and heterotypic interactions and vascular cell interactions with the surrounding matrix, soluble factors and circulating blood cells (leukocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes), in part, direct the vascular cells&#39; responses; yet little is known about these complex interactions and the mechanisms involved in information transduction from the extracellular environment to the cell nucleus.&lt;br /&gt;We are currently investigating the roles of selected homotypic and heterotypic cell adhesion molecules (PECAM-1 &amp; CD44), integrins (selected beta1, beta 2 and beta 3 integrins), junction associated molecules (VE-cadherin, ZO-1, Occludin) and extracellular matrix components (MMPs) in modulating vascular cell and T cell behavior (attachment, spreading, proliferation, migration, interactions with mononuclear (T) cells and angiogenesis). Specific projects in the laboratory currently include:&lt;br /&gt;1) Elucidation of the roles of the cytoplasmic domains of Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) and CD44 in modulating endothelial and T cell behavior, vascular development and dermal wound healing as well as the signaling mechanisms involved. We are investigating how differential tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain modulates associations with specific proteins including beta- and gamma-catenin; STAT3&amp;5, c-src, SHP-2 and small G proteins. We are also investigating the dynamic interactions between CD44 and CD31.&lt;br /&gt;2) Identification and elucidation of the signal transduction pathways activated following T cell-endothelial cell binding and subsequent CD44 and PECAM-1 signaling prior to, during and following T cell transmigration into tissues. We are investigating the mechanisms of induction, clustering and activation of T cell and endothelial cell matrix metalloproteinase-2 [MMP-2 ], membrane type matrix metalloproteinase [MT1-MMP/MMP-14], matrix metalloproteinases [MMP-9] and CD44. Selected knock out mouse strains (CD44 KO) are also utilized in animal models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.&lt;br /&gt;3) Elucidation of the mechanisms of hypoxia-driven cerebral angiogenic responses noted in the premature infant population and their association with neurodevelopmental handicaps. Animal, organ and tissue culture models of chronic hypoxia coupled with cDNA array analysis are used to investigate the responses of the cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and the roles of the vasculature in causing resultant neurodevelopmental handicaps. The dynamic roles of HIF-1alpha and Sox10 in endothelial and neural stem cell responses to and recovery from hypoxic insult are being investigated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>Title A Novel Approach to Measuring the Impact of Surgery in Craniosynostosis using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) Background Much debate surrounds whether children with non-syndromic craniosynostosis (NSC) sustain neurodevelopmental deficits. This controversy surrounding surgery in patients with NSC has initiated many studies involving neuropsychological measurements attempting to characterize the impact of surgical intervention on mental function.  However, early studies employing developmental quotients to test infants fail to adequately predict the impact of surgery on neurodevelopment. Unlike these primitive measures, studies utilizing event-related potentials (ERPs), based on cerebral electrical activity, in infants have been shown to be predictive of future outcomes. Objectives This study addresses previous shortcomings by using more sensitive neuropsychological measures in patients with NSC undergoing surgical correction. Furthermore, the study allows us to identify which infants with NSC are at risk of future abnormal language development and neurocognitive deficits. Moreover, ERPs can potentially serve as a standardized measure to assess surgical intervention.   Methods Infants with NSC were identified at the Yale Craniofacial clinic prior to surgery.  These patients underwent pre-operative testing using ERPs and will be tested post-operatively using the same technique.  Their results will be compared to age and gender matched controls.   Results Thus far, fifteen patients have subjected to the above protocol.  Once their post-operative testing is complete, they will be compared to control groups.     Conclusions If the results show that there is a significant difference between the way infants with craniosynostosis process speech sounds as compared to controls, this will provide evidence that surgical intervention is not merely a cosmetic procedure, but rather one necessary to prevent the impairment of neurodevelopment.  Also, comparing outcomes between infants subjected to surgery at different ages will elucidate the best timing for surgical intervention.   References   1. Kapp-Simon, K. A.

Once a rare condition, it has become a prevalent diagnosis since the early 1990s, concurrent with the American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommendation for supine sleep to reduce Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Traditionally, physicians have regarded positional plagiocephaly as a benign condition with no neurodevelopmental sequelae, but recent research has suggested some evidence to the contrary. These studies have relied on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) for their assessment. While BSID is the most commonly-employed developmental assessment tool in infancy, it is a poor predictor of long-term intellectual function, and may not be sensitive enough to detect very subtle developmental delays. Unlike BSID, event-related potentials (ERPs, cerebral electrical responses to stimuli) have been shown to be predictive of future cognitive outcomes by other research teams. However, ERPs have never been used to study neurodevelopment in plagiocephaly.   Objectives: This study seeks to establish baseline cortical ERPs for infants with positional plagiocephaly and determine if a difference exists between infants with the diagnosis and non-afflicted controls. As a secondary aim, we plan to investigate the effects of skull-molding helmet therapy on auditory ERPs.   Methods: Infants with positional plagiocephaly are being identified during consultation at the Yale Craniofacial clinic, and at the Cranial Technologies, Inc. office in Madison, CT. These infants will undergo two ERP sessions: one at baseline, and a second one after 3 months of skull-molding helmet therapy or physical therapy.   Results: Pending.   Conclusions: Neurodevelopment in positional plagiocephaly remains a debated topic. If the results of this study show a significant difference between infants with the diagnosis and non-affected controls in terms of auditory ERPs, they would provide evidence against the notion that plagiocephaly is an entirely benign condition. We will investigate whether the severity of deformation can be correlated with ERP differences. Additionally, if differences do exist between affected infants and controls, we will investigate whether helmet therapy and/or physical therapy can ameliorate them.   References: 1.

										<li>Despite remarkable recent progress in molecular and vascular biology research, little has been achieved in adapting traditional imaging modalities to detect molecular pathobiology in vivo. Molecular imaging provides a unique opportunity to link vascular and molecular biology and imaging, ultimately leading to the development of novel imaging approaches, both for research and clinical diagnostics. The ultimate goal of research in my laboratory is to develop novel imaging approaches to detect the molecular pathobiology of the vessel wall in vivo. Our comprehensive approach includes several components. Through basic vascular biology research we identify relevant molecular processes and potential targets for imaging (and therapeutics). Next, we use the state of the art technology to develop novel tracers targeted at relevant molecular markers, and establish molecular vascular imaging protocols in animal models of human disease. Finally, we exploit these techniques to further advance vascular biology and clinical research. We have made significant progress towards achieving these goals in the past few years. Specifically, we have focused on vascular remodeling, as the prototypic pathological vascular process shared by many vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, graft arteriosclerosis, post-angioplasty restenosis, and aneurysm formation. Our federally funded studies of the pathophysiology of vascular remodeling in graft arteriosclerosis, performed under the umbrella of the Interdepartmental Program in Vascular Biology and Transplantation at Yale have led to the identification novel molecular markers, including a neuropilin-like protein, ESDN, as a potential target for diagnosis and therapy of vascular remodeling. We have demonstrated that ESDN is upregulated in vascular remodeling, and have defined its function as regulator of vascular cell proliferation in vivo. We are currently in the process of defining other aspects of ESDN function, including its role in growth factor and integrin signaling pathways, and identification of ESDN ligands. In molecular imaging arena, we have identified and validated av&#223;3 integrin activation as a target for imaging the proliferative process in vascular remodeling, and have demonstrated the suitability of a?&#223;3-targeted tracers for imaging graft arteriosclerosis. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, as a key regulator of vascular remodeling, was targeted for in vivo imaging of injury-induced vascular remodeling and aneurysm formation using high resolution microSPECT imaging in conjunction with CT angiography for anatomical localization. We are currently in the process of optimizing the technical aspects of in vivo microSPECT/CT imaging to improve visualization and quantitation of molecular targets. In parallel, we have developed a novel “tracer design” concept for in vivo applications and have been involved in the development of a novel intravascular detection system which combines scintigraphy with high resolution optical coherence tomography imaging.

These patients have stimulated a number of collaborative studies on systemic effects of retinoids, on genotype-phenotype correlations and, currently, on revertant mosaicism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His lab has an ongoing program to demonstrate that epidermal desquamation can be harnessed to remove systemic toxins from the body. Using iron as a model toxin, pharmacological and transgenic mouse models are tested for their ability to reduce the body burden of iron in mice with hemochromatosis.  Appropriate interpretation of those studies has necessitated better characterization of iron homeostasis in keratincytes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lab also investigates methods to correct dominant negative gene defects in keratinocytes. One area of study is the use of triplex-forming oligonucleotides to induce mutations in a SupF reporter in mouse skin and in a keratin 6a-YFP reporter in tissue culture cells. The lab also participates in a large, international collaborative group, which has just completed a successful clinical pilot of siRNA to treat the mutant keratin disorder, pachyonychia congenita.</ins>

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My lab and program has a major focus on Gaucher disease on several topics including analysis of gene encoding lysosomal glucocere brosidase (GBA1), genotype/phenotype correlations, modifiers of Gaucher&#39;s phenotype, identification of novel Gaucher phenotypes through careful annotation of diverse phenotypes, macrophage-targeted enzymere placement therapy and development of murine models of the disease. We have used Gaucher&#39;s disease as a prototype single gene disorder affecting the liver to address other inherited metabolic liver diseases including Wilson&#39;s disease and glycogen storage disease type 1a.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My lab has developed methods to analyze complex GBA1 gene locus that harbors highly homologous pseudogene containing numerous known disease mutations; gene conversion events may to lead to transfer of pseudogene mutation to the active gene. Methods of gene analysis include ARMS-PCR and meta-PCR that permits resolution of active gene and pseudogene sequences. We are characterizing large populations of patients homozygous for N370S mutation (only found in active gene sequence and the most common disease mutation in people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry) and L444P mutation (the mutation present in normal pseudogene sequence and the most common pan-ethnic mutation world-wide). L444P homozygous genotype leads to severe disease with neurological involvement while N370S homozygosity leads tonon-neuronopathic Gaucher disease of extraordinarily diverse pattern. We recently showed that N370S homozygous Gaucher leads to adult onset disease with mild visceral involvement but progressive skeletal disease and high risk of multiple myeloma and other hematological malignancies. Similarly in characterizing a large cohort of Egyptian patients, we found L444P homozygous mutation leads to childhood onset of severe visceral and pulmonary disease with variable severity of neurologic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are examining several candidate genes in glycosphingolipid metabolic pathways and in pro-inflammatory pathways as potential modifier genes. We are also applying several genomic approaches to identification of modifier genes. Discovery of modifier genes will impact on patient management through more accurate prediction of prognosis and pre-emptive therapy of those at highest risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have had a long-standing interest in macrophage-targeted enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant glucocere brosidase expressed in CHO cells (imiglucerase), its efficacy in reversing multiple aspects of Gaucher&#39;s disease and its mechanism of action. We are an approved center for treatment IND issued by the FDA for mannose-terminated glucocere brosidase produced in human fibroblast cell line via gene activation technology (velaglucerase). We are also an approved site for an international multicenter phase 3 trials of a small molecule ceramideanalog Genz 112368, that is an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, exploiting substrate depletion approach to treatment of Gaucher disease. An important goal for us in the therapeutic area is small molecule pharmacological chaperones. To facilitate these studies, we are currently developing viable murine models harboring classic protein folding trafficking mutations of GBA1, i.e., N370Sand G202R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the extraordinary success of enzyme replacement therapy in Gaucher disease, virtually nothing is known about the true mechanism of action beyond proposed depletion of glycolpid-filled Gaucher&#39;s macrophages. We are currently conducting studies to address organ, cellular and gene expression responses to enzyme replacement therapy in our murine models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major limitation for further delineation of Gaucher disease has been lack of viable models of the disease that mimic human disease due to embryonic lethality. We have used CreLox technology to conditionally KO GBA1 in hematopoietic organs. This approach has led to an authentic mouse model of type 1 Gaucher disease, that recapitulates the entire human phenotype. Already this model is providing exciting new insights into disease mechanisms including important role of the adaptive immune system in development of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigation of Gauche disease is an excellent paradigm for delineation of other inherited metabolic diseases affecting the liver. In particular we are interested in Wilson’s disease and glycogen storage disease type 1a. Wilson&#39;s disease is also characterized by extreme phenotypic diversity and multiplicity of ATP7Bmutations with very poor genotype/phenotype correlations. We are exploring the possibility of genetic heterogeneity and are currently assembling appropriate pedigrees to conduct genome-wide association studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much metabolic diseases increase cancer risk, as we delineated for Gaucher disease. In glycogen storage disease type 1a, the incidence of hepatic adenomas is increased and there is high risk of transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma, despite good metabolic control.  We are conducting gene expression and genomic studies on tissues obtained at liver transplant inGSD1a. In the longer term we want to develop a long-lived mouse of GSD1a to study how and why adenoma develops in GSD1a and the steps that lead to hepatocellular carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;

In these studies we utilize we use biochemical, molecular, and cell biological methods to characterize the role of these proteins in signal transduction pathways in striatal neurons.

In these studies we utilize we use biochemical, molecular, and cell biological methods to characterize the role of these proteins in signal transduction pathways in striatal neurons. In addition, we use mouse models where striatal phosphoproteins and their targets have been “knocked out” to investigate the functions of these dopamine-regulated pathways in a variety of behavioral paradigms.

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 27pt;&quot;&gt;1.&lt;em&gt; Finding effective pharmacotherapies for individuals with alcohol dependence and comorbid psychiatric disorders.&lt;/em&gt; Although there is a large body of literature evaluating medications for the treatment of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, there are no established pharmacotherapies for individuals with comorbid psychiatric illnesses. Nevertheless, patients with substance dependence and comorbid mental disorders constitute the majority of patients in clinical settings, and the presence of comorbid mental disorders confers a poorer prognosis. Further, individuals with comorbid mental diseases have been systematically excluded from most efficacy studies of potential pharmacotherapies and more research is needed in this patient population. In fact, there is some evidence that patients with comorbid disorders may be less likely to get the treatment they need, particularly in mental health clinics. This research attempts to answer clinically relevant questions about efficacy, effectiveness and pharmacologic use in dually diagnosed individuals in order to better inform the development of treatments. This work has included a utilization studies about the use of naltrexone in alcohol dependent veterans; effectiveness studies such as a large effectiveness study with 254 veterans across 3 VA sites evaluating the use of naltrexone and disulfiram alone and in combination in a “real world” clinical setting. The results suggested that medications to treat alcoholism are safe and effective in these patients and more effective than no medication. Interestingly, there was no advantage to combination treatment. Individuals with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and those with psychosis did particularly well with medications to treat alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 27pt;&quot;&gt;In one of the first controlled studies to evaluate naltrexone for individuals with alcohol dependence and serious psychiatric disorder, patients with schizophrenia and alcohol dependence were randomized to naltrexone or placebo for a 12-week clinical trial. Naltrexone-treated patients had better alcohol related outcomes than placebo-treated patients. However, since naltrexone did not improve symptoms of psychosis or cognitive effects, further studies focused on treatments that might effectively treat symptoms of both disorders. Using administrative data, one study found that atypical neuroleptics are associated with no better outcomes than typical neuroleptics for substance misuse in schizophrenic patients. In a “proof of concept” treatment study evaluating a glutamatergic agent, a Stanley foundation-funded clinical trial was conducted using glycine as a treatment of both alcohol misuse and symptoms of schizophrenia. Preliminary results support previous research that glycine is effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but not alcohol consumption. It should be noted that the final data analysis is not yet complete. More recently and after the FDA approved acamprosate for the treatment of alcoholism, a study was funded and is ongoing evaluating acamprosate’s efficacy in patients with comorbid schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 27pt;&quot;&gt;Individuals with PTSD have some of the highest rates of comorbid alcohol dependence and this is an important clinical issue,particularly at the VA. A recently completed study was conducted comparing 2antidepressants (a noradrenergic agent versus a serotonergic agent) in treating symptoms of both PTSD and alcoholism. Preliminary results suggest there were no differences between the groups; the equivalent efficacy of a noradrenergic agent with the more standard serotonergic agent is a promising finding. Building on these results I have obtained grant funding from the Department of Defense to evaluate a novel noradrenergic agent in the treatment of PTSD and comorbid alcohol dependence. The study was funded in September of ’08.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 27pt;&quot;&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;Evaluating the underlying neurobiology of these disorders and the behaviors that go with them, including craving,self-administration and a familial vulnerability.&lt;/em&gt; Advances in the understanding of alcohol’s effects on the brain and the associated behavioral effects have contributed to our knowledge of alcohol abuse and dependence and have led the way to the development of new treatments. Alcohol is now known to have multiple specific actions in the brain. Alcohol’s acute and chronic effects on specific targets in the brain may in part explain ethanol reward, dependence and the vulnerability to alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 27pt;&quot;&gt;Dr. Petrakis&#39; research has focused on the serotonergic and glutamatergic systems and how these neurotransmitters affect craving, self-administration of alcohol and the vulnerability to develop alcoholism. Contrary to what might be expected from preclinical studies, 2 NIAAA-funded studies found there was no significant correlation of serotonin function with the magnitude of cue-induced craving and that cue included craving and alcohol self-administration were not dependent on ongoing synthesis of serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 27pt;&quot;&gt;Much evidence supports the role of the n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor in the pathophysiology of alcoholism. Another NIAAA-funded study evaluated whether healthy individuals at increased familial risk to develop alcohol dependence exhibit alterations in NMDA receptor function. This objective was evaluated by comparing the dose-related effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, in healthy individuals with a strong family history of ethanol dependence compared to healthy individuals without a family history. Interestingly, individuals with a family history were found to be less sensitive to the subjective effects of ketamine than those without a family history. These results are being followed up and in order to both replicate the findings and to determine whether certain genotypes predict outcome in a second-round of NIAAA funded studies. In a collaboration with Dr. Albert Perrino of the Department of Anesthesiology we are also evaluating whether altered pain sensitivity is also a marker for the vulnerability to develop alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 27pt;&quot;&gt;Two new areas of study include the examination of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mechanisms underlying both the subjective effects of alcohol and the vulnerability to develop alcoholism using a barbiturate probe, and the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in alcoholism. For the latter, a newly funded NIAAA grant (Sept 08) is examining the potential for the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine to attenuate alcohol use in alcohol dependent individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The significance of understanding
the relationship between GABA levels and cortical excitability.&lt;/em&gt;

Increased
cortical excitability is a hallmark of several human epileptic syndromes,
facilitating the spread of the seizure in the localization related epilepsies
and as a final common pathway for some of the primary generalized and myoclonic
epilepsies. Photosensitive epilepsy is the most common of the
stimulus-triggered (reflex) epilepsies, and there is considerable evidence,
developed primarily in animal models, that it is associated with impairments in
GABAergic inhibition, possibly secondary to alterations in GABA metabolism.
GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter and has a crucial role in
regulating cortical excitability. The concentration of GABA in both the
vesicular and cytosolic pools may have an important influence on GABAergic
inhibition. Our development of non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS) based measurements of cellular GABA in human cerebral cortex allowed us
to study GABA metabolism in human epilepsy. Our studies found profound
decreases in the level of cortical GABA in many patients with complex partial
seizures (CPS) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Our preliminary studies
suggest that GABA synthesis rates are decreased in patients with low GABA in
functional occipital cortex remote from the ictal onset zone. We found that, light-deprivation,
a condition that enhances excitability in the visual cortex, decreases GABA
levels in non-epileptic subjects in parallel with increased excitability measured
with paired-pulse stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation. These
results support an important role for cortical GABA level on cortical
excitability thereby facilitating the spread of seizure discharges from the
ictal onset zone to involve more normal functional brain. The primary goal is
to better understand the mechanisms by which GABA levels influence cortical
excitability, and the role of altered GABA levels in the etiology and
pathogenesis of epilepsy. Our primary general hypothesis is that reduced
cellular GABA levels result in an increase in cortical excitability through
decreased GABA release.

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The significance of the relationship
between GABA metabolism and cortical excitability.&lt;/em&gt;

There is a
renewed awareness of the interaction between metabolism and excitability as the
relationships between different aspects of neuronal-glial neurotransmitter
cycling are established. In order to fully understand the physiologic
consequences on GABAergic inhibition of altering neurotransmitter cycling, our approach
was to start at the final step and work backwards. We used a variety of
physiologic and analytic methods to examine the consequences of glutamic acid
decarboxylase (GAD) inhibition on network excitability in the rat hippocampus. We
used field and intracellular recordings from the CA1 region of rat hippocampal
slices to determine the physiological effects of blocking GABA synthesis with
the convulsant, 3-mercaptoproprionic acid (MPA). We measured the rate of
synthesis of GABA and glutamate in slices using 2-13C-glucose as a label source
and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The primary goal was to
establish whether GAD inhibition alone was sufficient to induce network
hyperexcitability in an isolated preparation comparable to that seen with GABA
receptor inhibition. The key findings were that inhibition of GABA synthesis
via GAD only produces hyperexcitability following repetitive stimulation,
demonstrating a pronounced use dependence when studied both intra and
extracellularly. This is consistent with the data showing that the regulation
of IPSC amplitudes and of GABA release can be regulated by glutamine
availability in use-dependent fashion. In addition, our data with NO-711, which
blocks neuronal GABA uptake, indicated that under baseline conditions, neuronal
GABA uptake does not provide a significant degree of GABA that is available for
release under resting conditions, but does once frank hyperexcitability has
been produced by repetitive stimulation. Despite this clear disinhibition, we
were unable to observe seizure-like activity comparable to that seen with GABAA
receptor blockade until basal excitability was increased with elevated extracellular
potassium concentrations. Finally, our data demonstrated that there is no
significant change in the size of the GABA pool, even under conditions where
synchronized activity is present. However, as expected, GAD inhibition with MPA
significantly decreased the amount of newly formed GABA. These biochemical data
demonstrated that full blown network excitability is seen only with a
combination of &gt;70% decrease in newly synthesized GABA with a concomitant
moderate elevation in neuronal excitability. Thus, these data are comparable to
those in circuit modeling studies showing that GABAergic inhibition is highly
context-dependent.

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understanding the role of
homocarnosine in modulating human cerebral excitability.&lt;/em&gt; 

One aspect
of GABA biochemistry that has not received significant attention is the role of
GABA-containing compounds. One such compound is homocarnosine, a dipeptide
formed from histidine and GABA.  The role
of homocarnosine in the human brain is poorly understood. Homocarnosine has
been proposed as an inhibitory neuromodulator, which is hydrolyzed into GABA
and histidine in the extracellular fluid (ECF), thereby increasing GABAergic
activity. Consistent with this proposal, studies of refractory human epilepsy
using vigabatrin show that CSF homocarnosine concentrations are significantly
higher in patients whose seizure control improved than in those who failed to
benefit. Free GABA concentrations were the same. Our own observational studies
of human epilepsy suggest that increased cortical levels of intracellular
homocarnosine appear to be associated with decreased cortical excitability. Low
intracellular homocarnosine and GABA levels, measured in the occipital lobe
using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), are associated with frequent
complex partial seizures in patients treated with valproate or lamotrigine. Patients
with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy with excellent seizure control and treated
with the same drugs usually have high homocarnosine levels, but very low
intracellular GABA levels. What is unknown is whether higher levels of intracellular
homocarnosine are a characteristic of patients with primary epilepsies, perhaps
compensating for the low intracellular GABA levels and contributing to better
seizure control by decreasing cortical excitability. 

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Topiramate, gabapentin and
levetiracetam are three new drugs that increase cortical homocarnosine
concentrations&lt;/em&gt;. The
mechanisms through which these drugs increase human homocarnosine levels are
unknown. Unlike vigabatrin, none of these three drugs alter intracellular GABA
concentrations in rodent models Topiramate and gabapentin increase human
cortical GABA levels within two hours of the first dose and homocarnosine
levels rise after one day (with topiramate) to one week (with gabapentin) of
daily use. Levetiracetam was studied only after two weeks of treatment. Our
studies using three antiepileptic drugs show that patients with refractory
complex partial seizures with better seizure control had higher homocarnosine
levels than those with poor seizure control. Cortical intracellular GABA levels
were the same in patients, who responded, compared with those, who failed to
benefit. The findings suggest, but do not prove, that homocarnosine may
decrease cortical excitability. The alternative explanation would be frequent
seizures either decreases the synthesis of homocarnosine or enhances its
catabolism. Taken as a whole these findings suggest, but do not prove, that
homocarnosine may decrease cortical excitability. 

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homocarnosine appears to directly
decrease neuronal excitability of the human hippocampus.&lt;/em&gt;

Mechanistic
studies have been carried out in whole animal and cell culture models, which
may not apply to humans because of the very low endogenous levels of
homocarnosine present in non-primate models. However, under conditions when
GABA is elevated, abundant homocarnosine is found in the rodent brain and CSF,
demonstrating that it can be synthesized de novo in the rodent.  Moreover, biochemical studies showed that
homocarnosine blocks GABA uptake into synaptosomes, suggesting that homocarnosine
has the potential to be an endogenous modulator of GABAergic function.  Our preliminary data using hippocampal slices
incubated in ACSF indicate that homocarnosine decreases neuronal excitability
in both rat and human hippocampus. We studied the effects of bath-applied
homocarnosine using electrophysiological recording techniques in the CA1 region
of rat hippocampal slices. We found that both homocarnosine and GABA shifted
the input-output relationship for evoked synaptic responses rightward and thus
was inhibitory. GABA and homocarnosine did not have additive effects,
suggesting a common mechanism of action. However, in intracellular recordings,
homocarnosine had no significant effects on the membrane potential and slightly
decreased the input resistance of the cells. Therefore, the dipeptide is not a
direct GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; agonist. 

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;An excess of extracellular glutamate
in the sclerotic hippocampus may be one of the key molecular causes of seizures
and brain damage in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;/em&gt;. Research by the Yale Epilepsy Clinical
Research group revealed that several important characteristics of the
epileptogenic human hippocampus include: above normal interictal extracellular
glutamate levels and enhanced glutamate release during spontaneous seizures
with abnormally slow post-ictal glutamate clearance. Paradoxically, interictal
extracellular glutamate concentrations were considerably higher in patients
with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE) than in patients without this pathology (non-MTLE),
despite the 60–80% neuronal loss and doubling of glial density in the sclerotic
hippocampus. Surprisingly, a considerable (35–40%) loss of glutamine
synthetase protein and activity was demonstrated in astrocytes of the epileptogenic
hippocampus resected from
patients with MTLE. Isotopic tracer (13C-glucose) studies during epilepsy
surgery suggested that the accumulation and impaired clearance of glutamate in
MTLE is due to a slowing of the glutamate–glutamine cycle metabolism in the
sclerotic hippocampus compared with the non-gliotic epileptogenic hippocampus. Based
on these data we hypothesize that elevated extracellular glutamate is a
consequence of impaired glial function due to both decreased rates of glial
uptake and/or metabolism. The isotopic enrichment of microdialysis (extracellular)
glutamine was higher for probes with nearly normal glutamate after infusion of
labeled substrates, which suggests the rate of glutamine synthesis, thus
glutamate detoxification, is lower in those areas of the brain with above
normal extracellular glutamate. The data obtained with an infusion of
13C-glucose or 13C-acetate on different days in the same subjects were the
same, which increased our confidence in the findings. The variation among
multiple probes in the same patient reflected regional variation in glutamine
synthesis and extracellular glutamate. Glutamine synthesis is limited to glia;
therefore, our data suggested glial dysfunction in regions with above normal
extracellular glutamate concentrations.

(MRS) based measurements of cellular GABA in human cerebral cortex allowed us
to study GABA metabolism in human epilepsy. Our studies found profound
decreases in the level of cortical GABA in many patients with complex partial
seizures (CPS) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Our preliminary studies
suggest that GABA synthesis rates are decreased in patients with low GABA in
functional occipital cortex remote from the ictal onset zone. We found that, light-deprivation,
a condition that enhances excitability in the visual cortex, decreases GABA
levels in non-epileptic subjects in parallel with increased excitability measured
with paired-pulse stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation. These
results support an important role for cortical GABA level on cortical
excitability thereby facilitating the spread of seizure discharges from the
ictal onset zone to involve more normal functional brain. The primary goal is
to better understand the mechanisms by which GABA levels influence cortical
excitability, and the role of altered GABA levels in the etiology and
pathogenesis of epilepsy. Our primary general hypothesis is that reduced
cellular GABA levels result in an increase in cortical excitability through
decreased GABA release.

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The significance of the relationship
between GABA metabolism and cortical excitability.&lt;/em&gt;

There is a
renewed awareness of the interaction between metabolism and excitability as the
relationships between different aspects of neuronal-glial neurotransmitter
cycling are established. In order to fully understand the physiologic
consequences on GABAergic inhibition of altering neurotransmitter cycling, our approach
was to start at the final step and work backwards. We used a variety of
physiologic and analytic methods to examine the consequences of glutamic acid
decarboxylase (GAD) inhibition on network excitability in the rat hippocampus. We
used field and intracellular recordings from the CA1 region of rat hippocampal
slices to determine the physiological effects of blocking GABA synthesis with
the convulsant, 3-mercaptoproprionic acid (MPA). We measured the rate of
synthesis of GABA and glutamate in slices using 2-13C-glucose as a label source
and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The primary goal was to
establish whether GAD inhibition alone was sufficient to induce network
hyperexcitability in an isolated preparation comparable to that seen with GABA
receptor inhibition. The key findings were that inhibition of GABA synthesis
via GAD only produces hyperexcitability following repetitive stimulation,
demonstrating a pronounced use dependence when studied both intra and
extracellularly. This is consistent with the data showing that the regulation
of IPSC amplitudes and of GABA release can be regulated by glutamine
availability in use-dependent fashion. In addition, our data with NO-711, which
blocks neuronal GABA uptake, indicated that under baseline conditions, neuronal
GABA uptake does not provide a significant degree of GABA that is available for
release under resting conditions, but does once frank hyperexcitability has
been produced by repetitive stimulation. Despite this clear disinhibition, we
were unable to observe seizure-like activity comparable to that seen with GABAA
receptor blockade until basal excitability was increased with elevated extracellular
potassium concentrations. Finally, our data demonstrated that there is no
significant change in the size of the GABA pool, even under conditions where
synchronized activity is present. However, as expected, GAD inhibition with MPA
significantly decreased the amount of newly formed GABA. These biochemical data
demonstrated that full blown network excitability is seen only with a
combination of &gt;70% decrease in newly synthesized GABA with a concomitant
moderate elevation in neuronal excitability. Thus, these data are comparable to
those in circuit modeling studies showing that GABAergic inhibition is highly
context-dependent.

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understanding the role of
homocarnosine in modulating human cerebral excitability.&lt;/em&gt; 

One aspect
of GABA biochemistry that has not received significant attention is the role of
GABA-containing compounds. One such compound is homocarnosine, a dipeptide
formed from histidine and GABA.  The role
of homocarnosine in the human brain is poorly understood. Homocarnosine has
been proposed as an inhibitory neuromodulator, which is hydrolyzed into GABA
and histidine in the extracellular fluid (ECF), thereby increasing GABAergic
activity. Consistent with this proposal, studies of refractory human epilepsy
using vigabatrin show that CSF homocarnosine concentrations are significantly
higher in patients whose seizure control improved than in those who failed to
benefit. Free GABA concentrations were the same. Our own observational studies
of human epilepsy suggest that increased cortical levels of intracellular
homocarnosine appear to be associated with decreased cortical excitability. Low
intracellular homocarnosine and GABA levels, measured in the occipital lobe
using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), are associated with frequent
complex partial seizures in patients treated with valproate or lamotrigine. Patients
with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy with excellent seizure control and treated
with the same drugs usually have high homocarnosine levels, but very low
intracellular GABA levels. What is unknown is whether higher levels of intracellular
homocarnosine are a characteristic of patients with primary epilepsies, perhaps
compensating for the low intracellular GABA levels and contributing to better
seizure control by decreasing cortical excitability. 

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Topiramate, gabapentin and
levetiracetam are three new drugs that increase cortical homocarnosine
concentrations&lt;/em&gt;. The
mechanisms through which these drugs increase human homocarnosine levels are
unknown. Unlike vigabatrin, none of these three drugs alter intracellular GABA
concentrations in rodent models Topiramate and gabapentin increase human
cortical GABA levels within two hours of the first dose and homocarnosine
levels rise after one day (with topiramate) to one week (with gabapentin) of
daily use. Levetiracetam was studied only after two weeks of treatment. Our
studies using three antiepileptic drugs show that patients with refractory
complex partial seizures with better seizure control had higher homocarnosine
levels than those with poor seizure control. Cortical intracellular GABA levels
were the same in patients, who responded, compared with those, who failed to
benefit. The findings suggest, but do not prove, that homocarnosine may
decrease cortical excitability. The alternative explanation would be frequent
seizures either decreases the synthesis of homocarnosine or enhances its
catabolism. Taken as a whole these findings suggest, but do not prove, that
homocarnosine may decrease cortical excitability. 

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homocarnosine appears to directly
decrease neuronal excitability of the human hippocampus.&lt;/em&gt;

Mechanistic
studies have been carried out in whole animal and cell culture models, which
may not apply to humans because of the very low endogenous levels of
homocarnosine present in non-primate models. However, under conditions when
GABA is elevated, abundant homocarnosine is found in the rodent brain and CSF,
demonstrating that it can be synthesized de novo in the rodent.  Moreover, biochemical studies showed that
homocarnosine blocks GABA uptake into synaptosomes, suggesting that homocarnosine
has the potential to be an endogenous modulator of GABAergic function.  Our preliminary data using hippocampal slices
incubated in ACSF indicate that homocarnosine decreases neuronal excitability
in both rat and human hippocampus. We studied the effects of bath-applied
homocarnosine using electrophysiological recording techniques in the CA1 region
of rat hippocampal slices. We found that both homocarnosine and GABA shifted
the input-output relationship for evoked synaptic responses rightward and thus
was inhibitory. GABA and homocarnosine did not have additive effects,
suggesting a common mechanism of action. However, in intracellular recordings,
homocarnosine had no significant effects on the membrane potential and slightly
decreased the input resistance of the cells. Therefore, the dipeptide is not a
direct GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; agonist. 

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;An excess of extracellular glutamate
in the sclerotic hippocampus may be one of the key molecular causes of seizures
and brain damage in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;/em&gt;. Research by the Yale Epilepsy Clinical
Research group revealed that several important characteristics of the
epileptogenic human hippocampus include: above normal interictal extracellular
glutamate levels and enhanced glutamate release during spontaneous seizures
with abnormally slow post-ictal glutamate clearance. Paradoxically, interictal
extracellular glutamate concentrations were considerably higher in patients
with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE) than in patients without this pathology (non-MTLE),
despite the 60–80% neuronal loss and doubling of glial density in the sclerotic
hippocampus. Surprisingly, a considerable (35–40%) loss of glutamine
synthetase protein and activity was demonstrated in astrocytes of the epileptogenic
hippocampus resected from
patients with MTLE. Isotopic tracer (13C-glucose) studies during epilepsy
surgery suggested that the accumulation and impaired clearance of glutamate in
MTLE is due to a slowing of the glutamate–glutamine cycle metabolism in the
sclerotic hippocampus compared with the non-gliotic epileptogenic hippocampus. Based
on these data we hypothesize that elevated extracellular glutamate is a
consequence of impaired glial function due to both decreased rates of glial
uptake and/or metabolism. The isotopic enrichment of microdialysis (extracellular)
glutamine was higher for probes with nearly normal glutamate after infusion of
labeled substrates, which suggests the rate of glutamine synthesis, thus
glutamate detoxification, is lower in those areas of the brain with above
normal extracellular glutamate. The data obtained with an infusion of
13C-glucose or 13C-acetate on different days in the same subjects were the
same, which increased our confidence in the findings. The variation among
multiple probes in the same patient reflected regional variation in glutamine
synthesis and extracellular glutamate. Glutamine synthesis is limited to glia;
therefore, our data suggested glial dysfunction in regions with above normal
extracellular glutamate concentrations.<del class='diffmod'>

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pettigrew’s research is driven by a desire to understand processes that tip the balance between asymptomatic colonization and disease. Because the risks of colonization and disease are associated with host characteristics, the biological agent, and the environment, her research requires an understanding of several different disciplines including epidemiology, microbiology, and statistics. One major project utilizes a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify tissue specific virulence factors of the gram-positive pathogen &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;S. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; colonizes the nasopharynx of up to 55% of healthy young children. Asymptomatic carriage is far more common than disease, yet these bacteria are important causes of otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Conjugate vaccine formulations are available for children, but these do not cover all 92 pneumococcal serotypes. Given these concerns, and increasing rates of antibiotic resistance among pneumococcal isolates, it is important to gain a better understanding of the virulence characteristics of &lt;em&gt;S. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; that influence their propensity to cause disease. It is also important that we understand the distribution of these virulence determinants among strains in circulation at the population level. This will facilitate the development of novel strategies to prevent pneumococcal disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Additional research projects focuses on the epidemiology of polymicrobial interactions between S. pneumoniae and other bacteria that colonize the same niche in the upper respiratory tract. Colonization by S. pneumoniae is a critical early step in the disease process. Several hundred different bacterial species colonize the upper respiratory tract of a single individual. Our research indicates that competitive interactions between bacteria in the nasopharynx differ by the number and type of bacteria species present. These data have implications for the development of probiotics and for antibiotic and vaccination strategies that target carriage of colonizing bacterial species. Such strategies may alter the nasopharyngeal flora, which may in turn have unintended consequences for disease incidence. We are expanding our research to examine interactions between bacteria and respiratory tract viruses (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus) and by taking advantage of recent advances in sequencing technology. Our newest projects utilize next generation  sequencing methods to characterize the microbial ecology of bacteria colonizing the upper respiratory tract of infants and young children. These data will also lead to increased understanding of the human microbiome and how competitive interactions between bacteria and viruses lead to disease.&lt;/p&gt;

Our specific aims are first, to characterize the organization of TJs, with emphasis on the role of claudin 5, in human continuous capillary ECs and determine how TJ proteins interact with each other and with the actin cytoskeleton. Second, to determine how TNF affects the organization of human capillary TJ proteins and identify those proteins whose expression levels are changed by TNF, resulting in TJ disruption and capillary leak. Third, to determine how KLF4 regulates TNF-induced changes in capillary ECs and if this can be exploited to control TNF-induced pathological changes.&lt;/p&gt;

The research in our
computational biology and bionformatics laboratory involves analysis of
genomics and proteomics experiments. This includes computational analysis of
output from high-throughput datasets generated from experiments involving
melanoma, breast cancer, hematopoeisis, cell cycle genomics, and
protein-protein interactions. The central focus of our earlier studies was to
reveal functional and regulatory gene modules using genome-wide data generated
in various &quot;Omics&quot; experiments and auxiliary information from
genomics databases.  We addressed issues of normalization and artifacts in
microarrays. Subsequently, we developed a novel spectral method for
bi-directional clustering of cancer microarray data to reveal regulatory gene
modules. The lab has also focused on extracting meaningful biological
information from experimental systems by assessing the co-expression of genes
regulated by various transcription factors, evaluating pathway expression and
building genetic networks based on functionality rather than pure
expression.  This approach is a step forward in identifying genes in
regulatory networks that are disrupted by mutations of tumor suppressors and
oncogenes and could shed light on the process of malignant
transformation.  Our research also involves the integration of sequence
information with genome-wide transcriptome and epigenome profiles. This
analysis has allowed us and our collaborators to reveal non-unique sequence
recognition motifs of transcription factors in an in vivo context and to
predict combinatorial regulation partners of transcription factors. Moreover,
this approach has allowed us to find spatial organization of transcription
factor binding events, as well as their relationships with other epigenomic factors.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The current computational
activities in our laboratory include the following areas: a) Application of
signal processing approaches for identification of relevant biological signals
in high-throughput experiments, such as identification of aberrations in
multi-subclonal cancer samples, signal denoising in next generation
platforms, and de-mixing of cell types in heterogeneous samples, b)
developing approaches to analyze high dimensional data from genomics platforms
for biomarker discovery and personalized medicine. In particular, we use
advanced applied mathematical methods to search complex local and non-local
genomic patterns across the genome that may discriminate cancer patients with
good vs. poor outcomes in CNA studies employing next generation sequencing or
SNP platforms and c) uncovering direct and collective regulatory relationships
between regulators (TFs, epigenomic factors and miRNAs) and their target genes
by integration of heterogeneous Omics datasets and DNA sequences.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From a biological
standpoint we are particularly interested in:

a)  
Identification of primary or drug-treated metastatic
subclones with proliferation and invasion potential in heterogeneous cancer
biopsies

b)

										<li>&lt;p&gt;I am interested in the role of complement inhibition in both kidney and liver transplantation. We are conducting an industry-sponsored study to assess if complement inbhibition with eculizumab can reduce antibody-mediated injury seen in kidney patients with donor-specific antibodies. I work with Jordan Pober MD PhD (Yale Immunobiology) on this study to assess what affect complement inhibition will have on graft endothelial cells. Given that donor specific antibodies may increase markers of endothelial cell activation, we are testing if complement inhibition will reduce activation and thus preserve graft function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living donation is a principal interest of mine, both clincally and academically. Previous work on living donor consenting practices and the need for better structured alibi&#39;s for donor has lead to a greater question on how transplant centers evaluate and approve living donors.

										<li>										&lt;p&gt;I am interested in the role of complement inhibition in both kidney and liver transplantation. We are conducting an industry-sponsored study to assess if complement inbhibition with eculizumab can reduce antibody-mediated injury seen in kidney patients with donor-specific antibodies. I work with Jordan Pober MD PhD (Yale Immunobiology) on this study to assess what affect complement inhibition will have on graft endothelial cells. Given that donor specific antibodies may increase markers of endothelial cell activation, we are testing if complement inhibition will reduce activation and thus preserve graft function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living donation is a principal interest of mine, both clincally and academically. Previous work on living donor consenting practices and the need for better structured alibi&#39;s for donor has lead to a greater question on how transplant centers evaluate and approve living donors. Clearly, this requires a balance between donor autonomy and center malefiecne. I am working with Carrie Thiessen MD PhD (Yale) whose experience in normative research methods has resulted in a multicenter portocol designed to assess risk perception in living kidney donors. &lt;/p&gt;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

In order to maintain systemic acid-base balance, the non-volatile portion of this acid load must be excreted by the kidney with equivalence between daily production and excretion. This is accomplished in two ways, one being regulation of base excretion (bicarbonate and citrate) and the other being regulation of acid excretion (titrated acids and ammonium). The proximal tubule of the kidney contributes to these processes by increasing proton secretion (primarily for bicarbonate reabsorption), ammonia synthesis and secretion (to buffer acid to be excreted), and citrate reabsorption and metabolism (to minimize base loss). Using both whole animal and cell culture models of a decrease in cell pH (the signal that initiates the physiological response), we are identifying and ordering the signaling intermediates that mediate the increase in apical membrane proton secretion by the Na/H antiporter isform NHE3 and citrate reabsorption by the Na-dicarboxylate co-transporter NaDC-1, and the increase in citrate metabolism and ammonia synthesis.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;We are generally interested in understanding the biology, structure, mechanism of action, and pharmacology (inhibition) of proteins that lead to infectious disease, inflammation, and cancer. Our studies are multidisciplinary and include structural biology (X-ray crystallography or NMR), high throughput screening and/or inhibitor design, structure-activity relationships, mutational analysis, the use of a strain of yeast as a model system for chemokines and their receptors, and animal models of disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our current studies include structure-function relationships of chemokines, a family of secreted proteins that recruit immune cells to the site of infection or tissue injury and function by activating specific G-protein coupled receptors. CXCL12 (SDF-1alpha) and vMIP-II/vCCL2 are an agonist and antagonist, respectively, for the GPCR CXCR4, a co-receptor for HIV-1. This receptor also mediates metastasis in a number of cancers, and a C-terminal mutation responsible for an immunosuppressive disease known as WHIM syndrome. Importantly, CXCR4 is the target for Plerixafor, a drug used in peripheral stem cell transplantation. We have determined the structures of CXCL12 and vMIP-II/vCCL2 and are working towards understanding their interactions CXCR4 at high resolution. We are also using random mutagenesis combined with yeast genetics to define smaller peptides with agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other major project is MIF. Inhibition of this &quot;cytokine&quot; MIF by neutralizing antibodies leads to therapeutic efficacy in animal models of sepsis, arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. This protein also inhibits the apoptotic activity of p53. The three-dimensional structure of MIF revealed a striking similarity with two microbial enzymes, including the presence of an enzyme-like crevice with catalytic functional groups. We are now attempting to determine the role of this site in inflammatory diseases and cancer. Interestingly, parasites also express and secrete this protein. In collaborative studies with Drs. Michael Cappello and Richard Bucala, we have determined the structure of MIF expressed from hookworm and Leishmania major, used high throughput screening, and structure-activity relationships to identify compounds with sub-micromolar Ki&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other projects include determining the structure of (1) signal transduction proteins involved in inflammation, and (2) enzymes that degrade chemotherapeutic agents.&lt;/p&gt;

We are interested in a number of disorders including Tourette’s syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, as well as drug addiction and Alzheimer’s disease. Our work focuses on a brain-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase called STEP and its role in regulating intracellular signaling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studies have shown that STEP expression is disrupted in over 10 different disorders. Some have have elevated levels of STEP while others have lower expression. Thus the current model is that optimal levels of STEP are required for proper synaptic function. Substrates of STEP include the kinases ERK1/2, Pyk2 and Fyn and dephosphorylation inactivates these enzymesem. STEP also regulates the cell surface expression of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors, and leads to their endocytosis. Signals that lead to the inactivation of STEP potentiate learning, while signals that lead to the activation of STEP oppose the development of synaptic plasticity. We use biochemical, molecular, immunocytochemical, and behavioral techniques to address the role that STEP plays in regulating aspects of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>My primary research interest is in pulmonary hypertension in Sickle Cell Disease. Pulmonary hypertension occurs in one third of adults with sickle cell disease and is an independent risk factor for mortality. There was limited data on this complication in children. I designed a prospective screening study with Dr Alan Friedman (Cardiology) and Dr Alia Bazzy-Asaad (Pulmonary) to determine the prevalence and risk factors of elevated pulmonary artery pressures in children with homozygous SS or S 0 thalassemia using echocardiography. This study identified that elevated pulmonary artery pressures do occur in approximately 30% of children with sickle cell disease, and are associated with hypoxia, hemolysis and a high platelet count. This was the first prospective screening study in children, and showed that similar to adults, children with sickle cell disease do develop elevated pulmonary artery pressures. This work was presented at the Pediatric Academic Society Meeting in May 2007 and published in Pediatrics (Pashankar FD, Carbonella J, Bazzy-Asaad A, Friedman A. Prevalence of elevated pulmonary artery pressures in children with sickle cell disease. Pediatrics 2008 Apr; 121(4):777-82). This study has been widely quoted and has had an impact on decision to screen children with sickle cell disease for pulmonary hypertension.   Our screening study showed that similar to adults, children with sickle cell disease developed elevated pulmonary artery pressures. In adults, this complication is associated with significant mortality. However there was no data on the long term outcome and possible reversibility of this complication in children. Hemolysis has been shown to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. I designed a single institution pilot study to determine if treatment with Hydroxyurea, an antihemolytic agent could reverse elevated pulmonary artery pressures in children with sickle cell disease. This study showed that elevated pulmonary artery pressures were reversible with hydroxyurea in children with early detection and intervention. This study is important, because if elevated pulmonary artery pressures can be reversed in childhood with early detection and intervention, it will have a significant impact on reducing morbidity and mortality of this complication in adulthood. This work was published in the British Journal of Hematology (Pashankar FD, Carbonella J, Bazzy-Asaad A, Friedman A. Longitudinal follow up of elevated pulmonary pressures in children with Sickle Cell Disease. Br J Haematol. 2009 Mar;144(5):736-41 ).   Due to the exciting results from our single center pilot study, we are currently conducting a multicenter study to determine the effect of hydroxyurea on elevated pulmonary artery pressures in children with sickle cell disease.   In addition to these studies, we have several studies that are ongoing through regional and national sickle cell networks.

										<li>Dr. Mayes’s research integrates perspectives from child development, behavioral neuroscience, psychophysiology and neurobiology, developmental psychopathology, and neurobehavioral teratology. She has published widely in the developmental psychology, pediatrics, and child psychiatry literature. Her work focuses on stress-response and regulatory mechanisms in young children at both biological and psychosocial risk. She has made contributions to understanding the mechanisms of effect of prenatal stimulant exposure on the ontogeny of arousal regulatory systems and the relation between dysfunctional emotional regulation and impaired prefrontal cortical function in young children. Her laboratory currently follows two longitudinal cohorts—one exposed to drugs prenatally and whose participants are now adolescents and another cohort of preschool aged children growing up in varying degrees of psychosocial adversity with the study focusing on the impact of economic deprivation on emerging executive control functions in preschool and early school-aged children. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the nature of her work with children at significantly high-risk for developmental impairments from both biological and psychosocial etiologies, Dr. Mayes also focuses on the impact of parenting on the development of arousal and attention regulatory mechanisms in their children. With other colleagues in the Center, she studies how adults transition to parenthood and the basic neural circuitry of early parent-infant attachment using both neuroimaging and electroencephalographic techniques. Most recently, she and her colleagues in the Center have developed a series of interventions for parents including an intensive home-based program called Minding the Baby and a group based intervention for parents called Parents First. Her research programs are multidisciplinary not only in their blending basic science with clinical interventions but also in the disciplines required including adult and child psychiatry, behavioral neuroscience, obstetrics, pediatrics, and neuropsychology. Indeed, in her work, Dr. Mayes’ collaborates across a number of departments—pediatrics, surgery and anesthesia, psychiatry, psychology—and has international (Israel, Great Britain, Canada, Italy) and national collaborators. She is a visiting professor at University College London where she participates regularly as a member of a research faculty training program and is also on the adjunct faculty of the University of Connecticut.

Dr. Mayes is also trained as an adult and child psychoanalyst and is the chairman of the directorial team of the Anna Freud Centre in London as well as the coordinator of the Anna Freud Centre program at the Yale Child Study Center. In this capacity, she focuses on developing research relevant to basic psychoanalytic theories of mental development as well as mentoring young scholars interested in the interface between psychoanalytic theory and developmental science. With her colleagues Peter Fonagy, Ph.D. and Mary Target, Ph.D. in London, she oversees a new masters program in psychodynamic developmental neuroscience offered collaboratively between University College London and the Yale School of Medicine.

										<li>										Dr. Mayes’s research integrates perspectives from child development, behavioral neuroscience, psychophysiology and neurobiology, developmental psychopathology, and neurobehavioral teratology. She has published widely in the developmental psychology, pediatrics, and child psychiatry literature. Her work focuses on stress-response and regulatory mechanisms in young children at both biological and psychosocial risk. She has made contributions to understanding the mechanisms of effect of prenatal stimulant exposure on the ontogeny of arousal regulatory systems and the relation between dysfunctional emotional regulation and impaired prefrontal cortical function in young children. Her laboratory currently follows two longitudinal cohorts—one exposed to drugs prenatally and whose participants are now adolescents and another cohort of preschool aged children growing up in varying degrees of psychosocial adversity with the study focusing on the impact of economic deprivation on emerging executive control functions in preschool and early school-aged children. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the nature of her work with children at significantly high-risk for developmental impairments from both biological and psychosocial etiologies, Dr. Mayes also focuses on the impact of parenting on the development of arousal and attention regulatory mechanisms in their children. With other colleagues in the Center, she studies how adults transition to parenthood and the basic neural circuitry of early parent-infant attachment using both neuroimaging and electroencephalographic techniques. Most recently, she and her colleagues in the Center have developed a series of interventions for parents including an intensive home-based program called Minding the Baby and a group based intervention for parents called Parents First. Her research programs are multidisciplinary not only in their blending basic science with clinical interventions but also in the disciplines required including adult and child psychiatry, behavioral neuroscience, obstetrics, pediatrics, and neuropsychology. Indeed, in her work, Dr. Mayes’ collaborates across a number of departments—pediatrics, surgery and anesthesia, psychiatry, psychology—and has international (Israel, Great Britain, Canada, Italy) and national collaborators. She is a visiting professor at University College London where she participates regularly as a member of a research faculty training program and is also on the adjunct faculty of the University of Connecticut.

Dr. Mayes is also trained as an adult and child psychoanalyst and is the chairman of the directorial team of the Anna Freud Centre in London as well as the coordinator of the Anna Freud Centre program at the Yale Child Study Center. In this capacity, she focuses on developing research relevant to basic psychoanalytic theories of mental development as well as mentoring young scholars interested in the interface between psychoanalytic theory and developmental science.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Through co-evolution with their hosts, viruses have acquired exquisite mechanisms for coping with the anti-viral immune responses. Our lab is interested in detailing these viral coping mechanisms and examining their importance to pathogenicity, with the eventual goal of developing better prophylactic and treatment strategies. The major pathogens that we study are the gamma-herpesviruses, which include the most recently described human viral pathogen, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This virus is the causal agent of one of the most common AIDS-associated cancers in the Western world, as well as being a leading cause of cancer deaths in many regions of Africa. We are in the process of characterizing several gene products of KSHV that are able to modulate and block the host immune response. Among these proteins are K3 and K5, able to down regulate multiple key immunomodulatory proteins from the surface of expressing cells, including MHC class I, B7.2, ICAM-1 and CD31. Studies of the molecular mechanisms of action of these proteins have not only provided potential targets for anti-viral therapies, but have also provided insights into the mechanisms of cellular endocytosis, trafficking and host control of the immune response. Another facet of our research is the characterization of the host immune responses being made against the virus. To aid us in these studies, we are taking advantage of several animal models utilizing closely related ?-herpesviruses including murid ?-herpesvirus (MHV-68) of rodents, Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) of New World non-human primates and rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV) of Old World non-human primates. In vitro gene expression and characterization experiments combined with in vivo infection experiments are allowing us to better describe the relationship between the virus and the host. These experiments have the promise of not only leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms of viral entry and tropism, but also to an understanding of what host responses are important to controlling viral infection, crucial in the design of anti-viral immunization strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>1) Immunology of Implantation: Studies are designed to understand immunological factors controlling the normal development of the trophoblast and its interaction with immune cells present at the implantation site. Our studies have identified the expression of Toll Like Receptors in trophoblast cells. These receptors allow the placenta to recognize and respond to any microorganism that may endanger the well being of the fetus.  &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the effect of viral and bacterial infection on fetal development based on the type of response originated at the placenta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2)Ovarian Cancer Translational Research laboratory” The major limitations in the treatment of ovarian cancer are: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i) the lack of an early detection tumor marker, and &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ii) the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.  Presently there is no commercially available test that is diagnostic for either early or advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer.  The most commonly used test, CA125, identifies a group of cell surface glycoproteins which have uncertain biological behavior and very limited clinical utility for the detection of early stage disease (less than 47% accuracy).   Chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer was introduced into the clinical practice more than fifty years ago.  Although this form of therapy has been successful for the treatment of some forms of cancer, it has not been the case for the majority of epithelial cancers of the breast, colon, lung and ovary.  In addition, the collateral damage to normal cells, systemic toxicity due to lack of specificity, rapid drug metabolism, and acquired drug resistance are important clinical problems that have not been solved.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The objective of the translational research program is to resolve  these limitations by: &lt;br&gt;1) Developing new markers for early detection &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Identifying markers that can predict chemoresponse &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Characterizing new therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Developing new markers: We have reported the characterization and validation of a new test for the early detection of ovarian cancer in high-risk patients. The test has been licensed to Labcorp and is now commercially available as OvaSure. Additional studies are on going to determine the value of the biomarkers to monitor recurrence.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New therapies: We have isolated and characterized the ovarian cancer stem cells, which may represent the origin of recurrence.  We identified a unique microRNA profile that differentiates these cells.  One of these microRNA, mir-199A, is a major regulator of the NFkB pathway, and could be use as a target and a marker for differentiation. In addition, we have identified a new compound, which targets ovarian cancer stem cells by inhibiting the mTOR pathway.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My research continues to be concerned with the clinical pharmacology of drugs of abuse. Earlier research focused on the clinical pharmacology of cocaine, and in particular cocaethylene (EC) an interesting metabolite, which arises through transesterification of cocaine when cocaine and ethanol are used concurrently. Our studies indicated that EC, like cocaine, blocks the reuptake of monoamines including dopamine, is reinforcing in animals, and cannot be discriminated from cocaine by humans. EC has a longer half life than cocaine, is somewhat less potent, and has greater selectivity for the dopamine transporter. We thus suggested that EC might serve as a prototype drug for agonist substitution therapy for cocaine abuse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My laboratory has received support from an NIH funded Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center. We have been involved with several tobacco abuse treatment trials, and nicotine challenge studies on the assumption that the outcome of such studies cannot be optimally interpreted in the absence of objective data regarding nicotine exposure (as reflected by concentrations of nicotine and/or its major metabolite, cotinine, in plasma). Nicotine, with its short half life is a good marker of acute or very recent nicotine exposure, while its major proximal metabolite, cotinine, with its slower disposition is the superior marker of chronic nicotine exposure. One of our previous interesting findings was that schizophrenics demonstrate about twice the plasma cotinine levels per cigarette smoked when compared to non-schizophrenic smokers. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that schizophrenics, many of whom are heavy smokers, are self-medicating their disorder with tobacco smoking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recently reported the results of a laboratory based study designed to quantify the relative reliability of various biochemical markers of smoking abstinence. Although, expired carbon monoxide (CO) is frequently used to confirm self reports, it has a relatively short half life, calling into question whether this measure might provide misleading information by exaggerating smoking cessation success rates. To examine this question, we analyzed expired CO, plasma cotinine and self report data collected in a clinical smoking abstinence clinical trial (N = 207). Measurements, which were made at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, showed that expired CO very significantly overestimated abstinence rates as compared with plasma cotinine. In fact self reports were more sensitive than expired CO. We conclude that outcomes of clinical trials for treatment of tobacco/nicotine abuse that rely on expired CO rather than cotinine measurements to verify sustained abstinence may significantly overestimate treatment success, and that cotinine measurements are much to be preferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most recently, we have been interested in two minor metabolites of ethanol , ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS). Assays for the parent drug and/or major metabolite(s) that provide a detection window of three or more days are available for most drugs of abuse. Such assays are important for clinical trials that evaluate new therapies for substance abuse disorders, as well as for patient management in treatment programs. Alcohol (ethanol) is an exception. Blood alcohol concentrations become undetectable within hours after ethanol consumption, even following heavy drinking. EtG and EtS are minor ethanol metabolites, that, using very sensitive assays employing tandem mass spectrometry, can be measured in urine for several days following alcohol consumption. Although studied for more than decade, mostly in Europe, their application has largely been in forensic and/or emergency room contexts. Moreover, the elimination of these minor metabolites, over a range of ethanol doses, has not been systematically studied. Guidelines for the clinical use of these potentially important assays have not been validated nor even well established. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We plan to perform an inpatient experimental study during which EtG and EtS elimination will be quantified following administration of varying doses of ethanol to volunteers employing a highly specific and sensitive LC/MS/MS assay We will also correlate urinary EtG and EtS concentrations with self reports in two clinical trials with goals of achieving abstinence and drinking moderation respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International: I am the Chair Designee for the Committee on Outreach and Developing world for society for education in anesthesia (SEA)- (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seahq.net&quot;&gt;www.seahq.net&lt;/a&gt;). My objectives for this year are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing crisis resource management tools like algorithms and making them handy for use in remote locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing a document with tips for teaching for residents going overseas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cofounder of Sim Worldwide (sww.etsu.edu). This is a website dedicated to increasing collabaration among medical schools in the US and abroad. Currently we transmit selected teaching sessions to the developing world. We have schools in India, Thailand, ElSalvador, China and Switzerland who log on to the sessions. We have one way video transmission and two way chat. This enables the session to be interactive for the audience abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Director of a monthly e-learning module for the PGY1 students who are coming into our program in anesthesia called the START (Successful transition to Anesthesia Residency Training) program- This is a collaboration with Stanford Anesthesia (Dr Larry Chu) who initiated the very successful program there. Tara Paulose, CA2 resident is co-director on this project. In this project we shoot short videos of pertinent topics which follow a trigger video to reinforce basic concepts in anesthesia to residents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yale Media Lab: We are currently involved in making videos for teaching. Erica Zador is the technical Assistant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulation- We use simulation to reinforce important concepts for our residents. Currently we are designing scenarios and testing them before applying to practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing a dedicated site for medical students who are interested in anesthesia to get information and interact. Our CA2 resident Shaun Gruenbaum and medical student Benjamin Gruenbaum are co-founders of this website. We are currently developing content for this website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-founder of an anesthesia multimedia website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anesthesiaillustrated.com&quot;&gt;www.anesthesiaillustrated.com&lt;/a&gt;). This is a collaboration with Stanford Aim Lab, again under the direction of Dr Larry Chu. The goal is to create a library of education media that can be used by faculty and students in the specialty for learning and teaching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a patient education website for anesthesia with information we got from the survey of our pre-operative patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using flashcard app to create flashcards for anesthesia residents to prep for their board exams. The project lead for this project is John Dicarlo, CA1 resident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are working on evaluating the feasibility of using video conferencing to evaluate patients before anesthesia. The project lead for this is Dr Michael Fishman, CA1 resident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a curriculum for teaching residents how to teach. This will be focused on residents who want to learn more on teaching and learning theories. We anticipate offering the courses starting 2013.&lt;/li&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;James F. Leckman, M.D. is the Neison Harris Professor of Child Psychiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology and Pediatrics at Yale. He serves as the Director of Research for the Yale Child Study Center. Dr. Leckman is a well known child psychiatrist and patient-oriented clinical investigator. His peers have regularly selected him as one of the Best Doctors in America. Dr. Leckman is the author or co-author of over 300 original articles published in peer-reviewed journals, seven books, and 120 book chapters. In 2002, he was identified by American Society for Information, Science and Technology as a “Highly Cited Researcher” - one of the world&#39;s most cited authors in Psychology and Psychiatry – in the top half of the top one percent of all publishing researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, he edited with Dr. Donald J. Cohen, Tourette&#39;s Syndrome: Tics, Obsessions, Compulsions - Developmental Psychopathology and Clinical Care, published by John Wiley&amp;Sons. Given its success, this volume was re-issued in paper back in the fall of 2001. More recently, Dr. Leckman edited (along with Andres Martin, Lawrence Scahill and Dennis Charney) a 56-chapter volume, entitled, Pediatric Psychopharmacology: Principles and Practice published in October of 2002 by Oxford University Press. In November 2002, an invited review article on Tourette’s syndrome appeared in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical expertise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Leckman is widely recognized as a committed clinician with special skills in the evaluation and treatment of Tourette’s syndrome (TS) and early onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Since the early 1980s, he has seen and evaluated hundreds of individuals with these conditions. Physicians, patients and families from across the country and around the world regularly seek his advice. He is frequently invited to address professional, parent and advocacy groups at local, regional, and national meetings as well as international meetings. For example during the past four years, he has presented to professional and/or family groups in London, Rotterdam, Berlin, Rome, Johannesburg, Istanbul, Beirut, Sharm El Sheikh, Tehran, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Tokyo, Mexico City, Lima, and Sao Paulo. He is also a fully trained psychoanalyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interdisciplinary research program on TS &amp; OCD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Dr. Leckman’s main research interests has been the interaction of genes and environment in the pathogenesis of TS and OCD. His research on these disorders is well known and multifaceted from phenomenology and natural history, to neurobiology (neuroimaging, neuroendocrinology, neuroimmunology) to genetics, to risk factor research (perinatal factors are important), to treatment studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2006 has been another productive year in the world of Tourette’s syndrome and OCD here at Yale. Headlining this year’s contributions are original articles appearing in Science and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. One of these reports identify for the first time variations in a gene SLITRK1 that confer vulnerability to develop Tourette’s syndrome. The other report is a study of donated postmortem brain tissue that documented dramatic changes in the cellular organization of individuals with severe, persistent, refractory Tourette’s syndrome. We are particularly pleased that several of the first authors of these reports are either currently Yale undergraduates (Diana Feygin), medical students (Jesse Abelson and Paul Kalanithi), or recent medical school graduates (Michael Bloch). This bodes well for the future of research in this area as we bring along the next generation of scientific leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current projects focus on the role of post infectious autoimmune processes that may play a role in the development and course of some forms of TS and OCD. We are also working collaboratively to understand more about the electrophysiology of TS and OCD. This work includes EEG and magnetoencephalographic studies as well as the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat individuals with severe forms of these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale Program on Risk, Resilience and Recovery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the support of Yale School of Medicine, the Institute for Research on Unlimited Love, and a group of private donors, Dr. Leckman partnering with Linda Mayes initiated a new research program that focuses on that special time in the lives of families – from the pregnancy through the first years of life. Under normal circumstances, this is a time of transformation - a time when families come into being and what new parents value changes forever, as well as a time when a new person begins their journey through life. Projects include a prospective longitudinal study of typically developing families. In additional behavioral assessments, brain imaging studies have been an important feature. Another core mission of the program is to facilitate synergism across existing programs of research within the Center and the University as well as with leading investigative teams nationally. These affiliated projects between together investigators at the Child Study Center, as well as those in Psychology, Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Epidemiology and Public Health, Laboratory Medicine, Diagnostic Radiology, and the School of Nursing. Some of the highlights of the last year included a second annual conference that was held in the spring of 2006, entitled: “Risk, Resilience and Recovery: The Formation of the Family and the Effects of Trauma and Recurrent Stress: From Animal Models to Model Programs and Social Policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drs. Leckman and Mayes also regularly teach an undergraduate seminar on Love and Attachment at Yale College that integrates the principles of evolutionary biology, ethology, and developmental neuroscience with the study of psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERICE (Empowerment and Resilience in Children Everywhere)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the support of the Fondazione per lo Studio e la Ricera sull&#39;Infanzia el&#39;Adolescenza, Italian Government, the International Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, Dr. Leckman convened child mental health professionals from Israel, the West Bank and Gaza to discuss how best to improve the lives of children in this region of conflict. From the first meeting in Jerusalem in 2004, this group continues to meet both in the region and in Europe. The last meeting was in Rome in July 2006 where we heard the ongoing results from the first funded joint project that is jointly led by Ruth Feldman (Israel) and Iyad Hallaq (West Bank). Theirs is a remarkable project that extends from the Israeli settlements in Gaza to the Palestinian neighborhoods of Nablus. It focuses on the effects of witnessing combat and catastrophe by infants and their families. At the meeting we also developed guidelines for the next round of grant requests. They include: (1) the likelihood of a positive impact for Palestinian and Israeli children; (2) that it will be a joint project involving Israeli and Palestinian professionals; and (3) that it will be feasible and will be capacity building. Thus far, we have secured external funding from NARSAD and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his leadership of the research program at the Child Study Center, Dr. Leckman has directed for the past 23 years an institutional postdoctoral research training program at Yale. With seven postdoctoral positions awarded annually, this is one of the largest grants of this kind awarded by the NIMH. Several of the graduates of this program now occupy leadership positions in child psychiatric research nationally. Dr. Leckman has been selected on five occasions as the Outstanding Research Mentor by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two years Dr. Leckman served as the Co-Chair of the National Psychiatry Training Council. The NPTC was appointed by Thomas Insel, MD, Director, the National Institute of Mental Health to implement the recommendations of an Institute of Medicine committee report entitled: Research Training in Psychiatry Residency: Strategies for Reform. This effort led to the inauguration of the Albert J. Solnit Integrated Child and Adult Psychiatry Research Pathway at Yale in 2004. With the support of Yale University School of Medicine, NIH, and a group of private donors the Solnit Integrated Research Training Program was initiated to increase the number of physician-scientists with clinical and research skills. Dr. Leckman leads this effort nationally and one other site is active at the University of Colorado where there are also six trainees enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002, to honor the memory of Donald J. Cohen, The Kingenstein Third Generation Foundation and the John &amp; Patricia Klingenstein Fund established the Donald J. Cohen Medical Student Fellowship program. Through early engagement with patients and their families, this program is designed to encourage medical students to become familiar with the special challenges associated with the care of children and adolescents with mental, behavioral and developmental disorders. Thus far, more that 80 Yale medical students have entered this program. Many are now envisioning careers in child psychiatry and a number are doing their thesis project with faculty at the Child Study Center. Based on the success of the Yale program the Board of the Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation has now funded five additional sites: Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Mt. Sinai, Stanford and the University of California at Davis. Here at Yale the other faculty involved in this effort include: Andres Martin, MD, MPH, and Samuel Ritvo, MD, along with a score of faculty mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

</del><ins class='diffmod'>&lt;br&gt;</ins>&lt;p&gt;One of Dr. Leckman’s main research interests has been the interaction of genes and environment in the pathogenesis of TS and OCD. His research on these disorders is well known and multifaceted from phenomenology and natural history, to neurobiology (neuroimaging, neuroendocrinology, neuroimmunology) to genetics, to risk factor research (perinatal factors are important), to treatment studies.&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffdel'>
</del>&lt<del class='diffmod'>;p</del><ins class='diffmod'>;br</ins>&gt;<del class='diffdel'> &lt;/p&gt;
</del>&lt;p&gt;2006 has been another productive year in the world of Tourette’s syndrome and OCD here at Yale. Headlining this year’s contributions are original articles appearing in Science and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. One of these reports identify for the first time variations in a gene SLITRK1 that confer vulnerability to develop Tourette’s syndrome. The other report is a study of donated postmortem brain tissue that documented dramatic changes in the cellular organization of individuals with severe, persistent, refractory Tourette’s syndrome. We are particularly pleased that several of the first authors of these reports are either currently Yale undergraduates (Diana Feygin), medical students (Jesse Abelson and Paul Kalanithi), or recent medical school graduates (Michael Bloch). This bodes well for the future of research in this area as we bring along the next generation of scientific leaders.&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffdel'>
</del>&lt<del class='diffmod'>;p</del><ins class='diffmod'>;br</ins>&gt;<del class='diffdel'> &lt;/p&gt;
</del>&lt;p&gt;Current projects focus on the role of post infectious autoimmune processes that may play a role in the development and course of some forms of TS and OCD. We are also working collaboratively to understand more about the electrophysiology of TS and OCD. This work includes EEG and magnetoencephalographic studies as well as the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat individuals with severe forms of these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffdel'>
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
</del>&lt;p&gt;Yale Program on Risk, Resilience and Recovery&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffmod'>
</del><ins class='diffmod'>&lt;br&gt;</ins>&lt;p&gt;With the support of Yale School of Medicine, the Institute for Research on Unlimited Love, and a group of private donors, Dr. Leckman partnering with Linda Mayes initiated a new research program that focuses on that special time in the lives of families – from the pregnancy through the first years of life. Under normal circumstances, this is a time of transformation - a time when families come into being and what new parents value changes forever, as well as a time when a new person begins their journey through life. Projects include a prospective longitudinal study of typically developing families. In additional behavioral assessments, brain imaging studies have been an important feature. Another core mission of the program is to facilitate synergism across existing programs of research within the Center and the University as well as with leading investigative teams nationally. These affiliated projects between together investigators at the Child Study Center, as well as those in Psychology, Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Epidemiology and Public Health, Laboratory Medicine, Diagnostic Radiology, and the School of Nursing. Some of the highlights of the last year included a second annual conference that was held in the spring of 2006, entitled: “Risk, Resilience and Recovery: The Formation of the Family and the Effects of Trauma and Recurrent Stress: From Animal Models to Model Programs and Social Policy.”&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffdel'>
</del>&lt<del class='diffmod'>;p</del><ins class='diffmod'>;br</ins>&gt;<del class='diffdel'> &lt;/p&gt;
</del>&lt;p&gt;Drs. Leckman and Mayes also regularly teach an undergraduate seminar on Love and Attachment at Yale College that integrates the principles of evolutionary biology, ethology, and developmental neuroscience with the study of psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffdel'>
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
</del>&lt;p&gt;ERICE (Empowerment and Resilience in Children Everywhere)&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffmod'>
</del><ins class='diffmod'>&lt;br&gt;</ins>&lt;p&gt;With the support of the Fondazione per lo Studio e la Ricera sull&#39;Infanzia el&#39;Adolescenza, Italian Government, the International Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, Dr. Leckman convened child mental health professionals from Israel, the West Bank and Gaza to discuss how best to improve the lives of children in this region of conflict. From the first meeting in Jerusalem in 2004, this group continues to meet both in the region and in Europe. The last meeting was in Rome in July 2006 where we heard the ongoing results from the first funded joint project that is jointly led by Ruth Feldman (Israel) and Iyad Hallaq (West Bank). Theirs is a remarkable project that extends from the Israeli settlements in Gaza to the Palestinian neighborhoods of Nablus. It focuses on the effects of witnessing combat and catastrophe by infants and their families. At the meeting we also developed guidelines for the next round of grant requests. They include: (1) the likelihood of a positive impact for Palestinian and Israeli children; (2) that it will be a joint project involving Israeli and Palestinian professionals; and (3) that it will be feasible and will be capacity building. Thus far, we have secured external funding from NARSAD and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffdel'>
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
</del>&lt;p&gt;As part of his leadership of the research program at the Child Study Center, Dr. Leckman has directed for the past 23 years an institutional postdoctoral research training program at Yale. With seven postdoctoral positions awarded annually, this is one of the largest grants of this kind awarded by the NIMH. Several of the graduates of this program now occupy leadership positions in child psychiatric research nationally. Dr. Leckman has been selected on five occasions as the Outstanding Research Mentor by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffdel'>
</del>&lt<del class='diffmod'>;p</del><ins class='diffmod'>;br</ins>&gt;<del class='diffdel'> &lt;/p&gt;
</del>&lt;p&gt;For two years Dr. Leckman served as the Co-Chair of the National Psychiatry Training Council. The NPTC was appointed by Thomas Insel, MD, Director, the National Institute of Mental Health to implement the recommendations of an Institute of Medicine committee report entitled: Research Training in Psychiatry Residency: Strategies for Reform. This effort led to the inauguration of the Albert J. Solnit Integrated Child and Adult Psychiatry Research Pathway at Yale in 2004. With the support of Yale University School of Medicine, NIH, and a group of private donors the Solnit Integrated Research Training Program was initiated to increase the number of physician-scientists with clinical and research skills. Dr. Leckman leads this effort nationally and one other site is active at the University of Colorado where there are also six trainees enrolled.<del class='diffdel'>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</del> &lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffmod'>
</del><ins class='diffmod'>&lt;br&gt;</ins>&lt;p&gt;In 2002, to honor the memory of Donald J. Cohen, The Kingenstein Third Generation Foundation and the John &amp; Patricia Klingenstein Fund established the Donald J. Cohen Medical Student Fellowship program. Through early engagement with patients and their families, this program is designed to encourage medical students to become familiar with the special challenges associated with the care of children and adolescents with mental, behavioral and developmental disorders. Thus far, more that 80 Yale medical students have entered this program. Many are now envisioning careers in child psychiatry and a number are doing their thesis project with faculty at the Child Study Center. Based on the success of the Yale program the Board of the Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation has now funded five additional sites: Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Mt. Sinai, Stanford and the University of California at Davis. Here at Yale the other faculty involved in this effort include: Andres Martin, MD, MPH, and Samuel Ritvo, MD, along with a score of faculty mentors.&lt;/p&gt<ins class='diffins'>;We are currently involved in a series of studies focused on tic disorders (Tourette&#39;s syndrome, TS) and early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). These include cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that focus on neuropsychological performance and clinical outcomes, genetics, the role of environmental factors (such as psychosocial stress and perinatal risk factors), neurobiology (brain imaging and post-mortem studies), immunobiology, as well as studies evaluating novel treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).&lt;br&gt</ins>;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;br&gt;Recent Yale Medical Student Thesis projects have included: &lt;br&gt;1. Longitudinal studies of the early adult outcomes of children with TS and early onset OCD. We have found that certain clinical indices, certain neuropsychological findings, and certain brain imaging findings are predictive of future tic and OC symptom severity in early adulthood.&lt;br&gt;2. Cross-sectional neuroimaging and dense array EEG studies looking at the role of sensorimotor gating.&lt;br&gt;3. Behavioral interventions that require focused attention and fine motor control appear diminish tic frequency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recent NIH funded studies include:&lt;br&gt;1. A multisite prospective longitudinal study of children with PANDAS with a focus of specific immune mechanisms and the role of psychosocial stress.&lt;br&gt;2. RTMS treatment of adults and adolescents with severe TS.&lt;br&gt;3. We are also participating in a number of multisite genetics consortia.</ins>

										<li>										<ins class='diffins'>&lt;p&gt;Research Projects in Lee Lab: The long-term goal of research in our laboratory is to understand how the processes of choosing appropriate behaviors and evaluating the outcomes of chosen actions are implemented by the neural networks in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia of the primate brain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neuroeconomics and decision making. During decision making, many different types of information about reward and penalty, such as their quality, magnitude, probability and delay, must be estimated and combined appropriately. We investigate how these different types of information are integrated in the brain and ultimately influences the animal&#39;s choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural mechanism of timing. Timing is critical for all kinds of cognition and motor behaviors, but how the brain encodes time and how this influences the nature of information processing in various parts of the brain remains  unknown.  We investigate how multiple temporal intervals are monitored by the neurons in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive functions of the basal ganglia. Clinical observations suggest that the basal ganglia plays an essential role in a variety of cognitive and motor functions.  We investigate how signals related to the animal&#39;s choice and outcome are transformed through the connection between the cortex and basal ganglia.  &lt;/p&gt;</ins>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM)&lt;/strong&gt;. We are investigating the biology of Ccm3, one of three genes implicated in the pathogenesis of CCM, a monogenic cerebrovascular disorder. We have generated a mouse model that develops vascular lesions highly similar to human cavernomas; its study has led to the identification of cell autonomous as well as cell non-autonomous functions of CCM3 in vascular and neural development, and has unraveled an important role of this protein in the neurovascular unit.&lt;/li&gt;

										<li>Dr. Lichtman’s primary research interests are the epidemiology of heart disease and stroke. As part of an initiative to achieve the disease objectives listed in the Healthy People 2010, the National Conference on CVD Prevention identified the need for better data to look at national trends across the population, and in subgroups defined by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography. Despite this initiative, the United States lacks a cohesive, informative surveillance system that provides insights into national patterns of vascular care, revealing national trends over time, and tracking long-term patient outcomes. To help address this gap, Dr. Lichtman has created a national, longitudinal, 14-year database from Medicare data to examine disease trends, patterns of care, and outcomes among elderly patients with heart disease and stroke. She is also Principal Investigator for several studies examining heart disease in young women. Despite perceptions that young women are protected from heart disease, it is one of the leading causes of death for this group. Her research examines biological, social, and environmental factors that influence the presentation and outcomes of young women with heart disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Lichtman has served on several national committees related to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders including the AHA Patient Education System Task Force, the AHA Peer Review Evaluation Design Task Force, the AHA Stroke and Epidemiology Councils, and the AHA Quality of Care and Outcomes Research Expert Panel. She has been a member of the Program Committee for the American Heart Association Conference on Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology and Prevention, and currently serves as the co-chair for a National American Heart Association Writing Committee and a recently appointed member of the American Stroke Association Advisory Committee.

										<li>Alzheimer’s dementia is the result of a cascade of
pathological processes  that work
in concert over many decades to reduce the number of functioning neurons of the
human brain that are responsible 
for memory and other executive actions. Neuronal cell death is believed
to be due to the accumulation of potentially toxic amyloid related peptides,
referred to as Abeta 40 and 42, through either their excessive production or
reduced clearance. Amyloid 
deposits can be removed from animal and human brains by specific
antibody treatments, and clinical trials using this approach are now under way. Antibodies
to fragments of amyloid abeta peptides are now recognized as biological agents
with great therapeutic potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two recent reports present evidence that naturally occurring
auto-antibodies to abeta might be neuro-protective. In one study
auto-antibodies to an aggregated form of abeta were found to be depressed in AD
patients, but, paradoxically, elevated in normal, young adults. A second report
describes a decrease in the incidence of AD in people treated with intravenous
immunoglobulin preparations Both results are consistent with the idea that
natural antibodies to abeta exist in all people and are depleted in advanced
AD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contrary
to these results, we have found that there is no clear correlation with levels
of anti-abeta antibodies and the clinical status of the donor. Antibodies to a
peptide fragment (p16-34) of abeta are elevated in many but not all individuals
with advanced AD. We have found that intravenous immunoglobulin preparations
also react with the p16-34 abeta fragment. If
naturally occurring antibodies to abeta are indeed neuro-protective, as the
available evidence suggests, it will be important to determine which epitopes
of abeta induce the protective response, and, equally important, to identify
the epitopes that might confer toxicity. The patho-physiological significance
of auto-antibodies to amyloid abeta peptides is clearly a complicated question
that deserves further study.

These studies employ a unique combination of murine modeling and novel bioengineering-based approaches, as well as studies in primary human cells, that are aimed at unveiling the immunopathogenesis of human lung fibrosis.  &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt&quot;&gt;The central focus of our laboratory is the role of Semaphorin 7a in these diseases. Semaphorin 7a (Sema 7a) is a neuronal guidance protein and immunoregulatory molecule about which little is known.  In addition to its role in axon guidance, Sema 7a participates in the activation of both macrophages and lymphocytes though its precise contribution to disease remains unclear. We have found that Sema 7a promotes a profibrotic monocyte phenotype characterized by the upregulation of scavenger receptors and secretion of selected soluble mediators, as well by inducing collagen expression in these circulating cells.  In fact, our work in a murine model of lung specific, doxycycline inducible TGFb1 overexpression demonstrates that hematopoetic expression of Sema 7a is sufficient to induce fibrosis in the murine lung, and that these effects are mediated at least in part via CD4+ T cells.  These latter findings are quite remarkable as while CD4 cells are known to be dispensible for the development of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, accumulating evidence suggests that T cells might promote or suppress fibrosis in certain circumstances.  Our data indicate that Sema 7a is a central mediator of these responses in the murine lung and, potentially in such diverse human diseases as IPF, Scleroderma related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Current studies in this area are aimed at clarifying the role of Sema 7a’s receptors (CD29 and Plexin C1) as well as other Sema 7a related molecules and signaling pathways in these processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P  style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt&quot;&gt;Another important area of Dr. Herzog’s work involves the application of bioengineering based strategies to the study of lung fibrosis.  As part of the first team to develop a bioartificial lung based on decellularized rat lung scaffolds suitable for in vivo implantation, Dr. Herzog has spent the last few years modifying these scaffolds for use in murine and human modeling systems and now has in place a dedicated scaffold based system that can support the growth of cell lines or primary. This approach is ideal in its ability to enable the studies of cell:matrix interactions. &lt;/P&gt;Last, perhaps most reflecting Dr. Herzog’s training as a physician scientist, the lab is also leading the search for predictive peripheral blood biomarkers of disease activity in IPF, SSc-ILD, and sarcoidosis.    As a member of the NIH funded MAPGEN and GRADS consortiums, the Herzog lab collaborates with physician scientists across the country to recruit, characterize, and immunophenotype peripheral blood samples from patients with a wide variety of fibrosing diseases.

MRSI allows the chemical composition of the brain, including major neurotransmitters and metabolites, to be mapped at spatial resolutions of 0.5 milliliter (approximately a cube of 1/3 of an inch) or better. These measurements allow us to evaluate the biochemical status of the brain, including: 1) how well neurons are functioning; 2) the extent to which energy production in the brain meets demand; and  3) levels of the primary inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters. Although we have worked in a variety of areas (Alzheimer’s, Multiple Sclerosis, Migraine, Addiction) our work currently focuses in two main areas: Epilepsy and Brain Tumors, with minor projects in Schizophrenia and Parkinson’s.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All of our human work is performed at 7T, of which approximately 25 system exist world wide. Spectroscopic studies are typically limited by SNR; however with increasing field strength, the SNR grows at least linearly. Unfortunately, power deposition grows by the second to the third power of the field strength, making conventional lower field (3T) spectroscopy methods unfeasible at 7T due to excessive tissue heating. Further due to tissue RF field interactions the homogeneity of conventional RF detectors degrades substantially resulting in a factor of two in inhomogeneity across objects the size of the human head. Finally the static magnetic field inhomogeneity grows linearly with field strength, degrading spectral resolution. To overcome these limitations the more technical components of our work focus on four areas: 1) the development of new multi channel (“transceiver”) RF arrays which improve homogeneity and decrease power deposition; 2) the development of specialized hardware and software for ultra high magnetic field homogeneity within the brain; 3) and pulse sequences which utilize RF shimming concepts to provide anatomical localization with out the use of gradients thereby minimizing power deposition and eliminating chemical shift dispersion errors and 4) pulse sequences to acquire measurements of a variety of metabolites including NAA, glutamate and GABA.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Although there has been significant advances in the development of new drugs to treat epilepsy, about 1/3 of all people who have epilepsy continue to experience seizures. These seizures have a significant impact resulting in shortened life spans, a much higher incidence of psychiatric disorders, and, on a personal level, increased incidences of divorce, loss of jobs and revocation of driving privileges. In these subjects, surgery can provide an alternative when the location within the brain giving rise to the seizures can be identified. In neocortical epilepsy, surgical treatment is typically only successful in &#189; of the patients due to the limitations of conventional imaging methods in finding the origin of the seizures. In many other patients a failure to localize the seizures or their proximity to areas of key brain function preclude surgery as a treatment option. In epilepsy our work includes two main areas: 1) the application of MRSI to identify where seizures originate from for the purposes of surgical planning and 2) to better understand the biochemical changes associated with epilepsy so as to develop alternative methods for the medical treatment of seizures for patients in which surgery is not an option.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brain cancer remains amongst the most difficult to treat of all forms of human cancer. Although there has been significant progress in the development of new agents and the use of focused radiation to treat brain tumors, results vary dramatically amongst individuals. For this reason, monitoring of the effects of treatment are critical in determining the course of therapy, balancing treatment of the tumor versus damage caused to the brain due to the toxicity of the agents and approaches used. Unfortunately, conventional imaging methods (MRI and PET) can not discriminate the effects of radiation and chemotherapy from tumor regrowth during the first few months of therapy, delaying optimal therapy. Failure to treat tumor regrowth quickly results in poorer outcomes and tumor control, while additional courses of radiation and chemotherapy result in significant brain damage and loss of function. Our work is focused on using MRSI methods to resolve between tumor regrowth and brain injury due to therapy, using characteristic changes in tissue energy production seen in radiation injury. By resolving tumor regrowth from radiation and chemotherapy injury we will be able to more optimally manage treatment, using additional radiation treatments or other chemotherapeutic agents for tumor regrowth, or giving steroids to treat brain injury due to therapy.

microRNA miR-430 that accelerates the deadenylation of maternal

Interestingly, misexpression of the human homologues (miR-372,
miR-17-93) have oncogenic potential. Thus, identification of the in
vivo miR-430 targets might provide a fundamental link between
development and cancer. 2) MicroRNAs are expressed at the onset of
differentiation and continue to be expressed through adulthood. We have
observed that miRNAs accelerate target mRNA degradation. Thus,
microRNAs targets can be identified by looking at mRNAs upregulated in
the absence of the microRNA. We are using microarray analysis in dicer
mutant embryos to identify tissue specific microRNA targets in neurons
and muscle cells. Computational projects in the lab will analyze the
regulatory motifs in microRNAs and 3’UTR elements of their targets to
identify the gene networks controlled by microRNAs. Combining in vivo
target identification with phenotypic characterization of dicer mutants
will help us to understand the function of tissue specific microRNAs

										<li>&lt;strong&gt;Gene targeting via triple helix formation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;From an interest in studying cellular DNA repair and recombination pathways, we recognized the utility of DNA triple helix formation as a mechanism for the site-specific introduction of DNA damage in mammalian cells. Using psoralen-conjugated triplex-forming oligonucleotides, we initially demonstrated the feasibility of triplex-targeted mutagenesis in several model systems. We were able to determine conditions under which triplex oligonucleotides can enter cells and efficiently bind to and modify a target site within cells, leading to base pair specific mutations. Experiments with oligonucleotides not tethered to a reactive agent but capable of high affinity third strand binding revealed that triple helix formation can induce DNA repair and recombination in mammalian cells. This work has raised the possibility of using triplex formation as both a gene knock out and a gene correction modality. It has also suggested that unusual DNA structures may provoke repair activity and may contribute to genomic instability. We are currently studying the feasibility of targeting chromosomal genes using this approach, either by directly inducing mutations in the target gene or by stimulating recombination in a site-directed manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumor hypoxia, genetic instability, and tumor progression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We hypothesized that that acquired genetic instability in cancer cells may arise from the dysregulation of critical DNA repair pathways due to cell stresses within the tumor microenvironment such as hypoxia. We initially confirmed this hypothesis by measuring mutation frequencies in experimental tumors using a lambda-based chromosomal shuttle vector reporter system. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon we used a microarray-based approach to screen for hypoxia-regulated DNA repair pathways. We found that hypoxia specifically down-regulates the expression of Mlh1 and Rad51, key mediators of DNA mismatch repair and of homologous recombination in mammalian cells, respectively. Down-regulation of Mlh1 and Rad51 expression by hypoxia was observed in numerous cell lines from a wide range of tissues, and was not correlated with cell cycle profile or hypoxia-inducible factor expression. Rad51 down-regulation was also detected in vivo in the tumor microenvironment, as we observed consistent inverse correlations between hypoxia-marker staining and Rad51 expression by immunofluorescence in cervical and prostate cancer xenograft models. We propose the existence of a hypoxic phenotype in solid tumors, characterized by decreased expression of the critical DNA repair genes, Mlh1 and Rad51, representing a novel mechanism of acquired genetic instability in the tumor microenvironment and dysregulated DNA damage response in cancer cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism of cancer cell killing by cisplatin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cisplatin is one of the most widely used cancer chemotherapy agents, but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Current models suggest that cell killing by cisplatin occurs in a cell-autonomous manner via formation of platinum-DNA adducts that, if not removed by DNA repair, block transcription and replication. We have found that there is a separate cell-interdependent pathway of cisplatin killing in which damaged cells can transmit a death signal to neighboring cells. This signal is produced within the damaged cell by the kinase function of the Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PK complex and is conveyed to the recipient cell by direct cell-to-cell communication through gap junctions. Our findings suggest that DNA-PK activity and gap junction expression in human cancers may influence the clinical response to cisplatin. In addition, strategies to manipulate these cellular components in conjunction with cisplatin treatment may provide new approaches to cancer therapy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA repair and mutagenesis in transgenic mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are carrying out mutagenesis studies using a lambda phage vector construct as a chromosomal shuttle vector in transgenic mice and mouse cells. We have determined that p53 overexpression can lessen mutagenesis by UV light, and we have examined the spectrum of x-ray-induced point mutations in mouse cells. In transgenic mice, we have found that locus specific effects can profoundly influence the mutation frequency in a reporter gene, and we have begun to study tissue-dependent variations in the pattern of spontaneous mutagenesis. Recently, we have created doubly transgenic mice carrying not only the lambda shuttle vector for reporting mutations but also a targeted disruption of the mouse PMS2 gene, a homolog of the E. coli mutL gene involved in mismatch repair. The human homolog of this gene has been associated with hereditary colon cancer. We are examining genetic instability in these mice using the lambda vector system. Preliminary work has shown elevated levels of mutation in all tissues tested, in contrast to the limited tissue distribution of cancer in the animals, a difference which highlights the complexity of cancer etiology.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Genetic Studies:&lt;/strong&gt; We use human genetic methods such as genetic association and sequencing studies to identify specific genes and genetic elements that contribute to dyslexia and language impairment. Methods range from specific interrogation of the DYX2 risk locus on chromosome 6p22 with a dense marker panel, to hypothesis-free methods such as genome-wide association and sequencing studies. We have collaborated with groups across the country and internationally to ascertain and collect subjects. Ongoing collaborations include the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) at the University of Bristol (UK), the Colorado Learning Disabilities Research Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder, The Child Language Research Center at the University of Iowa, Case Western Reserve University, as well as numerous other national and international collaborators. Our goal for these studies is to identify genetic elements that substantially contribute to reading- and language-related processes in order to (1) gain valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying dyslexia and language impairment—and also into the mechanisms underlying the biology of normal reading and language—and (2) attempt to use genetic information to identify children that may be at risk for communication disorders, in order to apply early intervention and improve the outcome for these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular Genetic Studies: &lt;/strong&gt;Our human genetic studies have recently uncovered a synergistic genetic interaction between two risk elements within the DYX2 locus: (1) READ1 (‘regulatory element associated with dyslexia 1’) within intron 2 of &lt;em&gt;DCDC2&lt;/em&gt; and (2) a risk haplotype within &lt;em&gt;KIAA0319&lt;/em&gt;, another known dyslexia risk gene in the same locus as &lt;em&gt;DCDC2&lt;/em&gt;. Using shift assays, mass spectrometry, and chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques, we determined that the potent transcription factor ETV6 specifically binds the READ1 element. Ongoing studies aim to determine the biological implications of READ1 and its possible regulatory capabilities, within DYX2 and throughout the genome. Future studies are planned to study the biological effects of READ1 alleles in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be differentiated into neural progenitor cells and terminally differentiated neural cells. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Yale Genes, Reading and Dyslexia (GRaD) Study:&lt;/strong&gt; The GRaD Study is a multi-center case/control study of the genetics of dyslexia in Hispanic-American and African-American children. Each child receives an extensive battery of standardized reading, language, IQ, attention, and motivation assessments. We collect DNA from every child in preparation for a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic markers informative in understudied populations in the U.S. and Canada. To date we have enrolled over 1100 children from recruitment and testing centers in New Haven, Boston, Toronto, Denver, Boulder, Albuquerque, and Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Imaging Genetics (IG):&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to traditional cognitive assessments, we also perform genetic association with non-invasive brain imaging phenotypes, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We use several MRI protocols, including structural (T2 and diffusion weighted imaging), functional, structural connectivity (fractional anisotropy), and functional connectivity. Subjects for these studies are recruited from the Pediatric Imaging NeuroGenetics (PING) Study, as well as the GRaD Study. The goal of these imaging-genetics studies is to connect risk variants from our neurobehavioral genetic studies to the biological phenotypes observed with high-resolution structural and functional imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT):&lt;/strong&gt;  This is a collaborative project with investigators at The Kennedy-Krieger Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.  The aim of this project is to examine the relationships between neuropsychological skills and candidate gene variants in children ages 8 to 15 years who display slow processing speed in the context of behaviorally defined sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT).  &lt;a href=&quot;#_msocom_1&quot;&gt;[I1]&lt;/a&gt; SCT is a collection of symptoms characterized by lethargy, under activity, and slowness, and has been observed in a variety of childhood conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia.  SCT and processing speed are considered overlapping yet distinct constructs. Children with ADHD commonly display slowed processing speed; however, slow processing speed is also sometimes observed in dyslexia. Therefore, processing speed and components of SCT may account, in part, for the comorbidity between ADHD and dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#_msoanchor_1&quot;&gt;[I1]&lt;/a&gt;I would move this to the end of the paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Antigen-specific immune mechanisms of chronic pain: This study will reveal a novel mechanism of chronic pain driven by the antigen-specific immune response via the effects of IgG immune complex on the Fc receptors expressed in primary sensory neurons. We will establish a unique animal model of chronic pain using an externally introduced antigen and study the role of IgG immune complex and the corresponding Fc receptors in pain-related behaviors as well as neuronal excitability in dorsal root ganglion. It will provide potentially new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of chronic pain.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanisms of hyperexcitability in primary sensory neurons after injury or inflammation in the peripheral nervous system: Injury or inflammation to the peripheral nerve, root, or ganglion can produce pain and hyperalgesia which often respond poorly to currently available treatment.  Neuronal hyperexcitability, especially the abnormal spontaneous activity in dorsal root ganglion neurons is believed to play a critical role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Using an animal model of chronic compression of dorsal root ganglion which simulates the radicular pain in human, we will explore the ion channel mechanisms underlying neuronal hyperexcitability with a combination of behavioral, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological, immunohistochemical and molecular biological methods. This study will provide valuable information for the understanding and treatment of chronic pain.&lt;/li&gt;

My laboratory is interested in the problem of embryonic
patterning.  A fertilized egg must
activate a complex genetic program in order to form functional adult
structures.  Failure to do so
correctly leads to congenital malformations in children, a significant cause of
inherited childhood diseases.

We are particularly interested in
cellular signals and transcriptional regulation that lead to particular fate
changes that specify new tissue types during development.  We are also interested in morphogenesis
that provides shape to the developing embryo.  We have three approaches to discover these patterning
events:  1) genetic screens in Xenopus tropicalis 2) quantitative analysis
of Xenopus epidermis to create a
coordinated field of cells 3) human genetic studies of children with congenital
malformations.

 

We focus on Xenopus
as a model system because of the power of the frog system for gain of function
and experimental embryology (“cut-and-paste” developmental biology).  In addition, we have pioneered X. tropicalis as an amphibian genetic
system because of its diploid genome and genomic tools.

Analysis
of X. tropicalis mutants

A number of mutants have been identified in previous genetic
screens and additional screens are ongoing.  Mutants that have been identified are now being cloned using
next-gen sequencing and exon capture arrays.  Once cloned, we are using all the power of the Xenopus
system to analyze gene function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysis
of human mutations using Xenopus

In collaboration with Lifton and Brueckner labs, we have
identified a number of genes that are mutated in patients that have congenital
heart disease, a failure to properly pattern the heart.  We have validated a number of these
genes by showing that they also cause abnormal development of frog hearts and
are now analyzing the mechanisms of their development.  Many of these genes are novel and
identifying their mechanisms of cardiac morphogenesis will lead to new
understanding of congenital malformations and the underlying developmental
biology.

  
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quantitative
analysis of a field of ciliated cells that create fluid flow

Specific cells on the epidermis of the Xenopus embryos are ciliated. 
These ciliated cells beat in a coordinated fashion to create flow across
the entire length of the embryo. 
How these cells generate flow and sense flow to coordinate their beating
remains uncertain.  We are using
advanced imaging techniques and quantitative biology to better understand how
cilia driven flow is established and maintained.  In addition, we have identified cilia mutants that have
abnormal flow and so combining mutants, morpholino knockdowns, ablations, and
transplants, we hope to better understand how local cells can coordinate
cellular pattern over a large field of cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</ins>

										<li>Normal DNA sequence variation such as single nucleotide

have made Homo sapiens amenable to many types of genetic analysis. We
are using these polymorphisms to study the genes for several
inherited disorders, including neuropsychiatric disorders, and working
on statistical methods to analyze the data. We are  studying these and other
polymorphisms genome-wide on DNA samples from many different human populations with
an emphasis on understanding the organization of normal variation
including studies of linkage disequilibrium and estimates of the
distribution of the variation in the entire species. We have
established a database, ALFRED, the ALelle FREquency Database, to
accumulate allele frequencies of DNA polymorphisms.  A current focus is on forensic uses of SNPs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the past several years my laboratory has studied the genetics of
complex human disorders, those disorders that fail to show a Mendelian
pattern but do &quot;run in families&quot;. DNA polymorphisms are now being used
to search for the genetic loci of major effect in behavioral and other
complex disorders. Our previous efforts focused on finding genes responsible for
neuropsychiatric disorders, especially Giles de la
Tourette Syndrome and schizophrenia.  While no locus
appears to account for all cases of Tourette Syndrome, we have
strong evidence of a predisposing genetic factor on the distal long arm
of chromosome 17. Studies are ongoing through collaborations to narrow the region and identify
the relevant variant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are studying the population genetics of expressed and
non-expressed genetic variation at several genes of known neurologic
relevance, such as the dopamine receptors D2 and D4 and the enzyme
COMT, Catechol-O-methyl transferase. Also, because of their
demonstrated relevance to alcoholism we are studying the genes involved
in ethanol metabolism, the ADH genes and ALDH2. Understanding the
nature of the common normal variation at these loci provides a
background for investigating how they might influence normal and
abnormal neurologic/metabolic function and susceptibility to
psychiatric disorders. The duplicated ADH Class 1 genes are unique to
primates and are the focus of molecular evolution studies.
Several more evolution-oriented projects are also being pursued.
These include theoretical studies as well as studying samples from
diverse human populations for DNA polymorphisms. For some genes of
interest we are also collecting DNA sequence of other great apes to
examine the origins of the human lineage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lab&#39;s efforts are
currently focused on genome diversity among world populations and
understanding how that diversity arose. We have accumulated cell lines
on individuals from over 45 different populations and plan to increase
this resource in the coming years. On a global basis we are finding
that the majority of alleles for nuclear DNA polymorphisms are present
in most populations around the world, though sub-Saharan African
populations have more genetic variation (alleles), in general, than
indigenous populations in any other part of the world. We interpret the
data to mean that there was a major founder effect and loss of
variation associated with the expansion of modern humans out of Africa.
Haplotype data collected on all of the populations we are studying are
beginning to reveal patterns that provide a better understanding of
that founder effect and the recent evolutionary history of modern
humans.  Recent studies have used these resources to select SNPs that
can be useful in forensics, both for individual identification
(matching the DNA at a crime scene with a suspect&#39;s DNA).  Other SNPs
are being selected for their value in inference of ancestry from an
individual&#39;s DNA.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bioinformatics research, in collaboration with the Yale Center for
Medical Informatics, is ongoing in two areas. We are working to improve
data management for the extensive marker typing results accumulating on
many of the projects. We are also working to improve the utility of

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My laboratory investigates mechanisms of lung injury and cytoprotection during oxidant stress.  Specifically, we have focused on the lung endothelium as a central mediator of lung injury and repair responses.  We identified the importance of the stress-response protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its gaseous reaction product, carbon monoxide (CO), in resisting oxidant-induced endothelial cell death via mitochondrial pathways.  We found that a family of signaling molecules, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), mediates HO-1 and CO’s protective effects as well as optimal IL-13-induced lung inflammation / remodeling and, more recently, critical innate immune responses.  The innate immune system consists of pattern-recognition receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs), of which TLR4 is the LPS-responsive receptor.  We discovered that TLR4 is required for lung structural cell survival in aging and oxidant-challenged conditions.  These studies represent important paradigm shifts in our understanding of TLR and lung biology and are now the basis of translational studies in people with acute lung injury and age-related chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive lung disease.  In the process of our investigations, we were the first to demonstrate the utility of intranasal, lung-targeted and endothelial-targeted silencing RNA (siRNA) constructs &lt;em&gt;in vivo.&lt;/em&gt; In parallel, we have also generated endothelial-targeted transgenic and knockout mouse models to specifically interrogate the role of the endothelium in lung disease.  Our coordinated use of siRNA technology and genetic approaches in both cell and mouse models offer immense insight into disease pathogenesis and may identify novel therapeutic targets for a range of lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

My research concerns psychosocial predictors of risk and mechanisms underlying addictive behaviors, principally high-risk alcohol use in young adults, cocaine use and smoking. The psychosocial risk factors and mechanisms of greatest interest to me concern disinhibition, both at trait and state levels. The decision to abuse substances is inherently impulsive in that it represents a choice of immediate reinforcers (e.g., euphoria from substance use) over larger, delayed reinforcers (e.g., avoiding adverse consequences). Therefore, the strength of association between addictive behaviors and aspects of disinhibition is not surprising. In recent years, I have become very interested in cognitive biases underlying addictive behaviors. For instance frequent substance users tend to devote inordinate attention to substance-related stimuli in their environment. Two of my primary research projects concern novel procedures to ameliorate these cognitive biases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;State and Trait Disinhibition &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Disinhibition” has been defined as the loss of restraint over some form of behaviour” (Bond, 1998, p. 42). Trait disinhibition can be manifested as any number of traits including types of impulsivity, sensation seeking and a propensity toward risk taking. These traits have been associated with alcohol use and increased risk of problem drinking in young adults (e.g., Anderson, Smith,&amp; Fischer, 2003; Grekin &amp; Sher, 2006). We also know that alcohol and other addictive substances can induce states of disinhibition, the behavioral output of which resembles that of trait disinhibition (Bond 1998; Lyvers, 2000). We know less, however, about alcohol-induced disinhibition as a predictor of problem drinking. We also know little about whether there are discernable types of alcohol-induced disinhibition. These issues are addressed in a recent review article (Leeman, Grant, &amp; Potenza, 2009). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Survey Research Concerning Disinhibition Expectancies and Impaired Control &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address these gaps in the literature, as part of my dissertation research, I developed the Drinking-Induced Disinhibition Scale (DIDS; Leeman, Toll, &amp; Volpicelli, 2007). The DIDS is a reliable, valid measure of expectancies of three types of alcohol’s disinhibiting effects (i.e., euphoric/social, dysphoric and sexual). In other words, this scale measures drinkers’ beliefs that they will experience certain effects to a greater extent when they drink than when not drinking. Since the initial work on the measure, we have completed a prospective study in which the DIDS, along with other variables assessed during freshman year, were included in models to predict problem drinking reported during senior year by a cohort of undergraduates (Leeman, Toll, Taylor, &amp; Volpicelli, 2009). The euphoric/social subscale—which measures expectancies that one will be more fun and social when drinking than when not—assessed during freshman year predicted unique variance in heavy episodic drinking reported during senior year. The DIDS has been translated into Danish (Hesse &amp; Tutenges, 2008). The convergent validity and the factor structure of the measure were confirmed in the Dutch study. At present, we are working on a new subscale to assess aggressive disinhibition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impairment in self-control can also manifest itself as difficulties in limiting one’s substance use. Impaired control over substance use (i.e., difficulties in limiting substance use, especially once initial use has begun) has long been viewed as a hallmark of addiction (Levine, 1978; O’Brien et al., 2006). My colleagues and I established that impaired control predicted unique variance in heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related problems (i.e., negative consequences of alcohol use and aspects of alcohol dependence) in cross-sectional models using the freshman year wave of the aforementioned prospective study (Leeman, Fenton, &amp; Volpicelli, 2007). Subsequently, we found that impaired control assessed during freshman year predicted unique variance in alcohol-related problems during senior year (Leeman, Toll, Taylor, &amp; Volpicelli, 2009). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Human Laboratory Models of Addictive Behaviors &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another area of my research is in human laboratory models of aspects of addictive behaviors. Specifically, I am interested in laboratory models that further my research interests in links between disinhibition and addictive behaviors. My colleagues and I completed a study in which we used a human laboratory model of smoking lapse behavior (McKee, 2009) to examine the combined effect of nicotine and food deprivation, compared to nicotine deprivation alone, on ability to resist smoking and on subsequent ad-libitum (i.e., open access) smoking behavior (Leeman, O’Malley, White, &amp; McKee, 2010). We found that when daily smokers were deprived of food in addition to nicotine, they had more difficulty resisting smoking their first cigarette than smokers who were nicotine deprived only. Recent findings have suggested, like substance use, deprivation can also induce disinhibition. Mitchell (2004) found that nicotine-dependent individuals were more likely to favor immediate cigarettes over delayed money when nicotine deprived than when not deprived. The laboratory model used in our study could be viewed as a model of deprivation-induced disinhibition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My colleagues and I have developed a human laboratory paradigm to model impaired control over alcohol use in young adults (Leeman et al., 2013). Initial evidence suggests that his paradigm has utility for testing the preliminary efficacy of treatments to reduce heavy drinking in young adults (e.g., cognitive bias modification procedures: see below). Given the prevalence (Wechsler, Lee, Nelson, &amp; Kuo, 2002) and deleterious results (Perkins, 2002) of heavy drinking among young adults, new, efficacious harm reduction approaches are needed for this population. A time and cost-effective method to evaluate these treatment approaches would be valuable to the field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interventions to Reduce Heavy Drinking in Young Adults&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I collaborated on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the combined efficacy of the FDA-approved, opiate antagonist naltrexone and BASICS (Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students; Dimeff et al., 1999) to reduce heavy drinking in 18-25 year olds. We conducted an open-label pilot study of this approach, the findings of which suggested that this line of research is feasible and potentially efficacious (Leeman, Palmer, Corbin, Romano, Meandzija, &amp; O&#39;Malley, 2008). This five-year NIAAA-funded study began in September 2007. The study contains a comprehensive battery of psychosocial predictors collected both intermittently throughout the study and on a daily basis during the screening and treatment periods. Inclusion of these assessments will permit analyses to identify mechanisms underlying the effects of this treatment approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are in the second year of a randomized, clinical trial to test a very brief (10 minutes or less), web-based alcohol reduction intervention for college students. This intervention, called THRIVE (Kypri et al., 2009) has been utilized successfully in Australia. We have adapted the intervention for use in the United States (US-THRIVE). In addition to attempting to replicate the Kypri et al. findings, we are conducting novel tests of focused sets of protective behavioral strategies included as part of this intervention. This intervention has great dissemination potential, given its accessibility, very brief duration and evidence for its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Biases Underlying Addictive Behaviors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, I have become interested in ways to ameliorate cognitive biases underlying addictive behaviors (Wiers et al., 2013). For instance, many substance users have automatic tendencies to approach these substances and related stimuli. I currently have two research projects to test new approaches to reduce these tendencies (i.e., cognitive bias modification): one involving frequent heavy drinking young adults and another for opioid-maintained cocaine users at the West Haven VA. &lt;/p&gt;

										<li>Dr. Kim’s major research efforts involve three areas: 1) The social and psychopathological consequences of school bullying; 2) Epidemiology of childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders; and, 3) The genetics and genetic epidemiology of childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Kim developed an interdisciplinary research team and completed a series of bullying studies in Korean elementary and middle schools. The purpose of these studies are to examine: (a) the time trend change of prevalence of bullying (either victim, perpetrator or victim-perpetrator); (b) trajectories of bullying behaviors; (c) risk factors that predict bullying behavior; and, (d) bullying as a risk factor in the development of psychopathology and suicidal ideations/behaviors. Parallel studies and anti-bullying intervention studies in US children and adolescents are under preparation.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently, Dr. Kim is conducting epidemiological studies, genetic studies, Gene-Environmental Interaction Studies and Neuroimaging Studies of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in South Korea. &lt;br&gt;1) The international research team screen and assess all school-aged children (N=45,000) from Ilsan (population 513,024). Cases are identified through the disability registry, school surveys and records and self-referrals, and subsequent diagnosis are made by employing a variety of standardized instruments: Korean versions of the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC), Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnosis Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Korean Wechsler Scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Leveraging already established infrastructure and research design in the community, our team continue to examine 6-year cumulative incidence of ASD in a prospective design for 2000 and 2001 birth cohorts. This study will provide first accurate incidence rate that was prospectively examined in a total population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Third area of research is to examine the roles of genes, environment and gene-environment interactions in the etiology of childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders. Dr. Kim completed a family-based association study to examine dopaminergic and serotonergic system genetic markers in Korean children with ADHD. Currently, a genetic epidemiological study of ASD is underway with epidemiologically-ascertained Korean ASD cohort in which the phenotype is carefully determined using state-of-the-art, standardized assessment methods and to generate hypotheses about genotypes, environments and GE interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Another large cohorts of children (N=10,000) have been recruited for genetics and GE interactions studies in CheonAn area. Social reciprocity of these children were measured by ASSQ, Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Behavioral Assessment Scale for Children-II (BASC-II) by their parents, their blood or saliva samples have been collected for the genetic analyses, and environmental exposures are measured biologically and with questionnaires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Children with ASD identified from ongoing prevalence and incidence studies and their sex, age and IQ matched control groups have been recruited for sMRI, fMRI and DTI studies to examine brain structure and function. Additionally, these data will serve for neuroigmaing-genetics study for ASD.

										<li>										In the common genetic disease, cystic fibrosis, mutations in a
transmembrane chloride channel the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
regulator or CFTR) are responsible for clinical manifestations in many
organs (lung, pancreas, GI tract). The most common mutation (delta F
508) results in defective trafficking of the protein to the cell
membrane. Agents that reverse this abnormality or that increase the
driving force for chloride secretion have the potential to treat this
disease. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt<ins class='diffins'>;We are studying the structure, function and regulation of CFTR
and other chloride channels in several sodium chloride secreting
epithelia, including mammalian airway cells, the kidney and the shark
salt gland. Specific projects include: 


&lt;br&gt</ins>;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulation of CFTR
trafficking from ER to cell membrane &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defining the role of SNARE
proteins and VAMP in the trafficking defect and possible reversal of
the CF phenotype &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identification of the role of CFTR in the human
renal disease, adult polycystic kidney disease &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K2P Role of K2P
potassium channels in chloride secreting epithelia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
We are also
carrying out physiological, molecular and structural studies of novel G
protein coupled receptors and natriuretic peptide receptors involved in
the regulation of chloride transport in marine models. This work is
done both at Yale and at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory
in Bar Harbor, Maine. 
Students will learn molecular techniques of
cloning, sequencing, expression, site specific mutagenesis and will
couple these techniques to structural (confocal microscopy using GFP
constructs, protein purification and crystallography) and
electrophysical measurements.Dr. Forrest is also carrying out
clinical studies in fluid and electrolyte disorders, including lithium
inducted diabetes insipidus, lithium intoxication, and hyponatremia.</ins>

										<li>&lt;p&gt;As a transplant physician, I have investigated the mechanisms and consequences of innate immune activation after organ transplantation. My laboratory was the first to demonstrate that Toll like receptor signaling via MyD88 accelerated the tempo of acute transplant rejection (JCI, 2003, AJT, 2004) and impaired transplant tolerance (JI, 2006, JASN, 2008). These were some of the first studies to show that Toll like receptors activate inflammation in sterile in vivo models. The activators of the innate immune system after transplantation have remained elusive. We recently discovered that haptoglobin stimulates innate immunity to induce inflammation after organ transplantation (JCI, 2012). As a result of our work some laboratories and pharmaceutical companies are targeting innate immune pathways to reduce inflammation after organ transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also interested in how aging impacts immunity, initially to determine if older transplant recipients exhibit altered immune responses to transplantation. My laboratory challenged the paradigm that declining immune function is responsible for age-associated disorders. In murine viral infection models, we determined that &lt;em&gt;exaggerated &lt;/em&gt;IL-17 production by NKT cells induces lethal immune pathology (Cell Host and Microbe, 2009). In murine vascular models, we demonstrated that &lt;em&gt;elevated&lt;/em&gt;inflammatory responses by vascular smooth muscle cells may predispose to atherosclerosis (ATVB, 2012). Finally, in murine transplant models we documented that &lt;em&gt;enhanced&lt;/em&gt; responses by na&#239;ve CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells may impair immune tolerance with aging (JI, 2011). In sum, we have made innovative findings, challenging current paradigms, that elevated immune responses explain age-associated phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How inflammation impacts organ transplantation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying inflammatory triggers that induce acute organ transplant rejection in experimental skin and heart transplant using non-biased approaches such as proteomics. The impact of this work is that it may identify novel targets to reduce intra-graft inflammation to improve outcomes after organ transplantation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employing nanoparticles to enhance allograft survival in experimental skin and heart transplant models. The impact of this work is that is may elucidate a novel platform to deliver immune suppressants to organ transplant recipients and avoid the side-effects of these medications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How aging impacts immune regulation to organ transplants. We are employing experimental models of organ transplant to elucidate novel age-specific pathways by which aging impacts the immune response to organ transplantation. The impact of this work is that it may reveal novel therapeutics to improve the efficacy of organ transplantation to older recipients, the largest pool of patients that are receiving organ transplants.&lt;/li&gt;

The alveolar macrophage response to the smoking challenge represents a continuum that ultimately leads to permanent lung function impairment. Secondhand smoke (SHS) is a recognized trigger of asthma exacerbations. However, the behavior of the alveolar macrophage from asthmatics after SHS exposure is only partially known.&lt;/p&gt;

Cigarette smoke disrupts that balance through exposure to inhaled xenobiotic particles, free radical production and immune activation. The alveolar macrophage response to the smoking challenge represents a continuum that ultimately leads to permanent lung function impairment. Secondhand smoke (SHS) is a recognized trigger of asthma exacerbations. However, the behavior of the alveolar macrophage from asthmatics after SHS exposure is only partially known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current project is focused on the characterization of the molecular response to SHS in airway macrophages of asthmatics.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>Hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis using bone marrow derived stem and progenitor cells Projects in the lab focus on molecular mechanisms that regulate early hematopoiesis and may be dysfunctional in leukemogenesis. Specifically, we are using primary cells as well as murine and human embryonic stem cells to study RBM15 and MKL1, two genes that are fused in the t(1;22) translocation associated with Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia AMKL). We are studying the roles of RBM15 and MKL1 in normal myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis.   We have shown that RBM15 is downregulated as hematopoietic stem cells differentiate down the myeloid lineage such that megakaryoblasts express low levels of RBM15. When RBM15 is overexpressed, it prevents myeloid differentiation, and when RBM15 is inhibited or deleted, myeloid differentiation is enhanced, and there is a loss of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell self-renewal. RBM15 is a member of the spen family of proteins that share a C-terminal SPOC domain that bind to the nuclear corepressor complex. Consistent with other members of the SPOC domain family that can affect Notch signaling, we have shown that RBM15 represses Notch induced Hes1 promoter activity. RBM15 coimmunoprecipitates with RBPJk, a critical transcription factor in the Notch signaling pathway. Thus, RBM15 plays a role in hematopoiesis by maintaining myeloid cells in an undifferentiated state, and this activity is mediated by inhibition of Notch signaling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MKL1, identified at the C-terminus of the t(1;22) translocation specific to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, is highly expressed in differentiated muscle cells and promotes muscle differentiation by activating serum response factor (SRF). The Krause laboratory has shown that MKL1 expression is upregulated during murine and human megakaryocytic differentiation, and that enforced overexpression of MKL1 enhances megakaryocytic differentiation. When the Human Erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line is induced to differentiate with TPA, overexpression of MKL1 results in an increased number of megakaryocytes with a concurrent increase in ploidy. MKL1 overexpression also promotes thrombopoietin-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of primary human CD34+ cells. The effect of MKL1 is abrogated when SRF is knocked down, suggesting that MKL1 acts through SRF. Consistent with these findings in human cells, knock out of MKL1 in mice leads to reduced platelet counts, and reduced ploidy in bone marrow megakaryocytes. Thus, MKL1 promotes physiological maturation of human and murine megakaryocytes.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Differentiation of marrow-derived cells into epithelial cells The focus on plasticity is based on a very exciting discovery in the Krause laboratory that bone marrow derived cells are capable of differentiating into non-hematopoietic cells throughout the body. In 2001, we published our finding that a single bone marrow derived cell could engraft the hematopoietic system and differentiate into mature epithelial cells in mice, and in 2002, we published that the same occurs in humans. Since that time, we have focused on several important questions regarding this plasticity including which cell populations in the bone marrow are responsible for this plasticity, and how these cells are regulated. We have shown that bone marrow transplantation leads to amelioration of renal mesangial sclerosis, and we have shown that bone marrow derived cells can engraft as functional epithelial cells in the GI tract and airways of mice with cystic fibrosis. In studies to determine the mechanism(s) by which BM cells become epithelial cells, we have discovered that this involves at least 2 different mechanisms, one involving cell fusion and the other not. We hypothesize that hematopoietic cells can only take on the gene expression pattern of epithelial cells via cell fusion, but that other nonhematopoietic cells in the BM (and perhaps elsewhere), can differentiate into epithelial cells without cell fusion.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Developing a better understanding of the neurobiological and behavioral adaptations produced by substance use is crucial to developing optimal behavioral relapse prevention and pharmacological strategies to help initiate and maintain abstinence. To this end, my research focuses on understanding a a host of factors that mediate the intensity, content and duration of abstinence such as sex/gender, age, concurrent substance use and depression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a treatment development perspective, we are primarily focusing on two separate areas. In the first, we have developed and are using an alcohol self-administration paradigm in alcohol dependence drinkers to screen new medications that could reduce drinking behavior. In the area of tobacco dependence, we are developing innovative school-based prevention and cessation programs for adolescent smokers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the area of alcohol drinking, we are interested in understanding alcohol drinking behavior and evaluating the efficacy of new medications in reducing drinking behavior. This research is conducted using a human laboratory alcohol drinking paradigm for adult heavy drinkers developed by our group at Yale. Laboratory paradigms provide researchers with the opportunity to manipulate factors that may have predictive utility in treatment outcome in a controlled environment. Using this paradigm to evaluate naltrexone, one of two FDA approved medications for alcoholism, we recently demonstrated that naltrexone reduced drinking only in drinkers with a positive family history of alcoholism. Thus, the efficacy of naltrexone, while modest in unselected samples, may be maximized by targeting the treatment to those with a genetic risk for alcoholism. Currently, we are using these laboratory paradigms to evaluate the influence of glutamatergic agents on alcohol drinking behaviors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use of many substances, particularly tobacco, alcohol and marijuana is established during adolescence. Unfortunately, we know little about what maintains substance use behaviors in adolescents and there are few empirically validated treatments for this population. We have shown for the first time that while adolescent smokers show minimal symptoms on traditional withdrawal measures during abstinence from cigarettes, there are clinically significant gender-related changes in stress responses and cognition. These findings suggest that adolescents may be smoking to modulate stress reactivity and cognitive performance and emphasize the need for gender-specific treatments addressing tobacco-abstinence induced changes. We have used surveys to examine the relationships between a number of high risk behaviors including substance use, gambling, stealing among high school and middle school students, as well as to examine adolescents perceptions and attitudes towards school-based prevention and cessation programs. We have also used behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to evaluate the role of personality factors like impulsivity and risk taking behaviors in predicting both initiation and cessation of substance use in adolescents. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the area of adolescent tobacco use, we are developing unique prevention and cessation programs that use behavioral reinforcement techniques. For example, we have developed a unique school based cessation program for adolescent smokers that uses Contingency Management (CM) based techniques to reinforce tobacco abstinence in combination with cognitive behavioral smoking cessation therapy. CM is an approach that reinforces target behaviors (such as abstinence) and has had a profound effect on the field of behavioral therapies for substance use in adults. We have adapted this approach to the unique needs of adolescent smokers and initial results from this program are extremely promising and suggest that CM could be used to initiate abstinence in this high risk population of smokers. We are now working on methods to enhance the efficacy of this program by understanding predictors of treatment outcome, and including pharmacotherapies and other behavioral interventions to address the influence of these of predictors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More recently, we have focused our efforts on developing a school wide “Tobacco free and Win” program designed to motivate high school smokers to not use tobacco products. This unique program is being developed using input and feedback from students and administrators and will be designed to motivate a school-wide tobacco-free lifestyle. Finally, we are conducting developmental work on marijuana education, prevention and cessation programs in high school students and are also extending our research to examine biobehavioral correlates of initiation of substance use, and develop interventions for middle school students.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>A large body of evidence has demonstrated that increased inflammation can produce depression. In subjects without depression, inflammatory cytokines are associated with negative mood, and in patients with depression, plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines are elevated. Certain anti-inflammatory medications, such as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and TNF antagonists, can ameliorate depressive symptoms. A variety of inflammatory stimuli can cause depressive symptoms. In patients treated with interferon-alpha (IFN-a), 20-45% develop depression. IFN-a causes increases in plasma levels of TNF and IL-6, cytokines commonly elevated in patients with idiopathic depression. Certain vaccines can cause transient depressed mood, and so can stimulation of the innate immune system with low doses of endotoxin. Endotoxin, a cell wall component of gram negative bacteria, is a potent stimulus of the innate immune system. When administrated to humans, endotoxin at doses of 2-4 ng/kg causes flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches, whereas lower doses (&lt;1 ng/kg) cause milder symptoms that are more similar to what occurs in depression, including fatigue, anhedonia, depressed mood, and impaired cognition. Because endotoxin-induced sickness behavior shares many features with depression, we are using it is an experimental paradigm to study the potential role of inflammatory cytokines in depression. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that endotoxin or TNF administered peripherally causes expression of inflammatory mediators in brain parenchyma. Likewise, in monkeys peripheral administration of IL-1 led to increased levels of IL-6 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and in patients receiving IFN-a treatment, CSF levels of IL-6 also increased. These studies demonstrate that in both rodents and primates, when peripheral levels of inflammatory cytokines increase, inflammatory pathways in the brain can be activated. Neuroinflammation could contribute to depression and other neuropsychiatric syndromes through interactions with monoamines, glutamate and neuroplasticity. We are trying to develop an imaging method that can reliably measure neuroinflammation in vivo. A protein called translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), located on the outer membrane of mitochondria, is present at very low levels in healthy brain tissue. Expression of TSPO is upregulated in a wide variety of neuroinflammatory or neurodegenerative disorders. In rodents, inflammatory mediators including endotoxin induce TSPO expression in the brain. Because current TSPO PET and SPECT tracers have a poor signal-to-noise ratio, there are several ongoing efforts to develop better tracers for TSPO imaging. We are testing both SPECT and PET tracers in various experimental immune system activation models.

										<li>Harvey J. Kliman is currently
a Research Scientist in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale
University School of Medicine and the Director of the Reproductive and
Placental Research Unit with a special interest in infertility and pregnancy
complications. His has three areas of research interest:&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menstrual Cycle Regulation and Embryo Implantation Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Menstrual cycle regulation is a critical step in embryo implantation
and successfully achieving pregnancy. Since a majority of cases of unexplained
infertility may result from implantation failure, there is a need to assess the
endometrium accurately for defects that could preclude implantation. Current
tools for endometrial evaluation, however, are limited. Based on endometrial
expression of cyclin E and p27, we have developed a patented endometrial
function test (EFT&#174;) which allows us to evaluate at a molecular level the
menstrual cycle regulatory cyclins and to differentiate between normally and
abnormally developing, endometrium. Ultimately, we hope this test will prove
useful to reproductive endocrinologists in evaluating menstrual cycle
irregularities as well as implantation potential. In addition, given that
cyclin E and p27 are regulated by estrogen and progesterone, this test may have
a role in evaluating the effects of these hormones’ exogenous administration in
infertility treatments as well as in other circumstances such as hormone
replacement therapy of peri- and post-menopausal women and in clinical
conditions that are known to alter or disrupt normal menstrual cycle function.
Currently the EFT is used to evaluate patients with infertility and recurrent
pregnancy loss. The full potential of these markers will need to be established
with prospective, case-controlled multi-center trials that examine different
groups of infertility patients to investigate the accuracy of the EFT in
predicting pregnancy outcomes in natural cycles, IVF, and donor oocyte
patients, work that is currently underway in our laboratory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Defects in the Placenta Suggest the Presence of
Genetic Defects in the Fetus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the basis of the structure of biological systems are genes that
regulate the development of the cells that make up the tissues and organs. We
humans start off as a symmetrical ball of cells. Even as our first 50 cells
begin to separate themselves into an inner cell mass (which will become the
embryo, fetus and, eventually, baby) and the trophoblasts (which will become
the placenta), genes are regulating the creation of the developmental axes that
will form the basis of the entire organism. Defects in the genes that regulate
these processes lead to a wide range of embryonic, fetal and neonatal defects,
from minor cosmetic abnormalities, to disasters that terminate pregnancy within
a few days to weeks after fertilization. Since the placenta and fetus share the
same genome, genetic defects in the fetus are often mirrored in the placenta as
abnormal growth patterns. The cellular basis of these placental growth patterns
is the dynamic relationship between cytotrophoblast replication and
differentiation towards syncytiotrophoblast. We have identified an abnormal
growth pattern of the trophoblast layers which appears to be associated with
genetic defects in the fetus: trophoblast invaginations. When these deep pits
are cut in cross section they appear as trophoblast inclusions. We have shown
that compared to the placentas from normal children there is a significantly
increased frequency of trophoblast inclusions in cases of known chromosomal
diseases, such as trisomy 21, 13 and 18, as well as triploidy (three sets of
chromosomes). More recently we have demonstrated an increased frequency of
inclusions in cases of subtle genetic diseases, including autism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novel method of determining placental
volume reduces the risk of intrauterine
growth restriction (IUGR)
and intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have developed a mathematical solution to accurately estimate intrauterine
placental volume.  Care
givers of pregnant women currently only track the growth of the fetus without
any insight into the growth of the
placenta, despite its importance in prenatal development.  The placenta is the
critical organ responsible for both respiratory and nutritional support of the
fetus.  In
situations where the placenta is significantly small or large for gestational
age, a care giver may not
have any warning that the fetus is compromised or near death until it is too
late.  Fetal complications due to placental abnormalities
occur in as many as 20% of
pregnancies.  Clinical intervention is possible with
early detection.  This
invention allows for assessment
of in
utero placental volume using three
basic measurements:  width,
height and thickness of
the placenta.  There are no alternativeCurrently there are no simple, reliable or convenient methods to determine
the volume and/or weight of a placenta prior to delivery available today. We propose to use this method to
generate normative data on a large population of pregnant women which can be
used to automatically flag abnormal placental size. Such normative data will
form the basis for the generation of tables which can be incorporated into
future ultrasound devices. This will empower future caregivers to identify and
intervene in cases where an IUFD would have been the first indication of any
problems. This method will create a “placenta tank” gauge where none has
existed.This compromises a health
care provider’s ability to assess the state
of a pregnancy since the placenta is the critical organ responsible for both
respiratory and nutritional support of the fetus. Currently care givers of pregnant women only track
the growth of the fetus without any insight into the growth the placenta. In situations where the

										<li>Our primary scientific interest is to better understand how the structural and biophysical properties of proteins contribute to their role in pathophysiology of human disease. NMR spectroscopy is a central tool in our research program used to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins in solution and to monitor a variety of biophysical properties under physiological conditions. At the moment, we are investigating a number of biomedically important protein systems, which are briefly summarized below. A detailed description of some of our ongoing research efforts can be found below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular basis for pH-dependent regulation of protein hormone function.&lt;/strong&gt; The overall goal of this project is to define the biophysical basis for the pH dependence of human
prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH)-receptor recognition and to
characterize its functional importance during intracellular trafficking of
endocytosed hormone-receptor complexes. Secreted protein hormones and cytokines
experience multiple regulated variations in solution acidity, or pH, during
their functional lifecycles. Briefly, after synthesis and transport into the
endoplasmic reticulum, secreted proteins are initially exposed to a near neutral
pH, which is later acidified to around 6.0 in the trans-Golgi and to 5.0 in the
dense cores of secretory granules. Once released into extracellular fluid, the
pH varies from 6.5 – 7.8; but, after recognition and activation of cell surface
receptors, endocytosed ligand-receptor complexes experience a step-wise
lowering of acidity first to pH ~ 6.5 in mature endosomes, to pH ~ 5.5 in late
endosomes, and, if not directed back to the cell surface for recycling, to a
lysosomal pH &lt; 5. Given recent evidence for continued receptor signaling
from the endosomal compartment and for the complex intertwining of the signal
transduction and endocytic machineries, the overall activity of protein
hormones must depend on their response to these regulated changes in localized pH.
In a sense, protonation of ionizable groups in proteins is analogous to the
interaction of other cations, such as Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that
allosterically regulate protein function. In particular, the imidazole
side-chain of histidine residues is ideally suited to serve as the primary
sensor of variations in acidity across the pH range 5.5 – 7.5. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have chosen
to focus on the protein hormones, hPRL and hGH, and their respective cell
surface receptors (hPRLr and hGHr) due to our previous experience investigating
this protein family
and our discovery of a nearly one thousand-fold loss of binding affinity of
hPRL for its receptor over the narrow range of pH from 7.5 to 6.0; whereas, the affinity of hGH
binding to the same receptor remains essentially constant. We hypothesize
that this difference in pH dependence depends entirely on structural changes in
the intermolecular interfaces of these two hormone receptor complexes. We
will also test the hypothesis that acid-induced dissociation of endocytosed
hormone-receptor complexes (or lack thereof) regulates intracellular trafficking
towards either lysosomal degradation or recycling back to the cell surface. Our approach relies on a combination of measurement of site-specific protonation reactions using both NMR spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry, modeling of the thermodynamic linkage between receptor-binding and protonation, high resolution structural analysis of hormone-receptor complexes, and complementary cellular studies. Projects are currently available combining any of the above methodolgies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Molecular Mechanism for Hematopoietic Cytokine Receptor Activation and Transduction of Cell Signaling. The long-term goal of this project is to delineate the specific structural and functional interactions involved in hematopoietic cytokine receptor activation and signal transduction. However, given our previous experience with the hPRL and hGH receptor subfamily, current efforts are exclusively focused on these two cytokines. Although best known for its traditional role as a pituitary-derived hormone, recent research has established important autocrine/paracrine functions of prolactin (PRL) in the growth and development of a diversity of tissues. PRL and its receptor are expressed in cancers of the breast, prostate and female reproductive tract. PRL has mitogenic and angiogenic function in these tumors and increases cancer cell motility. Whereas a vast majority of pituitary-derived PRL is secreted as the full-length, unmodified protein, in peripheral tissue glycosylated and phosphorylated variants of PRL are found. Research has demonstrated functional consequences of these modifications, some of which may act to counter the tumorigenic effects of unmodified PRL. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, we have successfully expressed, purified and refolded the extracellular domain of the hPRL receptor extracellular domain (ECD), along with its separate fibronectin-like III) subdomains (S1 and S2). The isolated S1 and S2 domains can be prepared in milligram quantities and are both highly soluble and stable in aqueous buffer, allowing the application of high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques to the analysis of their structural properties. We hypothesize that the hPRL receptor homodimerizes in at least two alternate conformational states, associated with the active and inactive states of the receptor. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Projects are immediately available in the laboratory involving the structural and biophysical characterization of these receptor ECDs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polymorphic Drug Metabolizing Enzymes. &lt;/strong&gt;Research over the past 30 years has demonstrated striking genetic variability in the enzymatic pathways used to metabolize xenobiotics (drugs, poisons, pollutants, etc.) in the human body. This metabolic diversity complicates the administration of pharmaceutical agents to combat disease, resulting in variable levels of efficacy and toxicity from the same dosage of medications applied across a population. Ideally, the selection and dosing of individual medications would be specifically tailored to a predicted response within an individual. The scientific study of this genetic diversity and its relation to the administration of pharmaceuticals is the focus of the developing field of pharmacogenetics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One common biological mechanism for generating diversity in metabolic pathways involves inherited polymorphisms in the protein sequence of enzymes, which appear to target the polymorphic proteins for intracellular degradation. We would like to understand the structural and biophysical mechanisms by which genetic polymorphisms within the protein sequences of these enzymes modulate their relative role in drug metabolism and, consequently, on the variable efficacy and toxicity of administered pharmaceuticals. Our work so far has concentrated on the enzyme, thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which metabolizes the class of 6-thiopurine medications, including 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine and azathioprine. Large variations of TPMT activity exist in humans and a variety of genetic polymorphisms in the TPMT protein sequence have been identified that target the allelic variants for proteasomal degradation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have determined the three-dimensional structure of TPMT using NMR spectroscopy and characterized the consequences of ligand-binding on the conformation and molecular dynamics of the polypeptide backbone. We are currently analyzing the consequences of the polymorphic mutations on the structural and functional properties of TPMT in order to characterize the molecular basis for increased susceptibility to intracellular degradation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GLUT4-tethering protein, TUG. &lt;/strong&gt;This project focuses on the 
interactions between the insulin-regulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, 
found in muscle and adipose cells and a recently discovered protein, 
TUG, that regulates GLUT4 trafficking. Discovered by our collaborator, 
Dr. Jonathan Bogan, TUG binds directly to GLUT4-containing vesicles and 
tethers them intracellularly. In response to insulin, TUG releases GLUT4
 allowing translocation to the plasma membrane. Like many other 
proteins, TUG is composed of a modular array of independent protein 
domains. Our long term goal is to determine the tertiary 
structures of these TUG domains, to structurally characterize their 
interactions with each other and with a number of associated proteins, 
and ultimately to develop a detailed molecular model for TUG-regulated 
GLUT4 trafficking. A combination of sequence analysis and experimental 
studies has identified a number of ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains in TUG. We
 have chosen these UBL domains as the initial focus of our structural 
studies because of (1) their demonstrated functional importance in 
TUG-mediated GLUT4 tethering and release, (2) the clear delineation of 
their structural domain boundaries based on sequence alignment, and (3) a
 pre-existing knowledge base of their potential interactions partners 
based on the conserved functions of homologous UBL domains in other 
proteins. The results of these studies will benefit diabetes 
research both by contributing to a better understanding of the cellular 
mechanism for insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking, and also by 
structurally characterizing novel targets for the rational design of 
pharmaceutical agents with the potential to modulate cellular glucose 
uptake.

The overall objective is to determine which disturbances cause these neural systems to most clearly reproduce language disturbances characteristic of persons with schizophrenia, i.e., positive thought disorder, negative thought disorder, and fixed delusions. The latter are simulated as the narrative production of locked-in, repetitively reproduced untrue emotion-charged stories. Simulation studies are conducted in parallel with a human subject study involving narrative memory and reproduction that compares patients with schizophrenia and normal controls.

										<li>With my wife and scholarly colleague, Nadeen Kaufman, I have developed tests of intelligence, achievement, and neuropsychological functioning, beginning with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) in 1983 and extending to the present day.  We are currently in the tryout phase of developing the KTEA-III, a revision of the 2004 test, the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement--2nd ed. (KTEA-II), and we are also working on a thorough revision of the 2004 KABC-II.  Our most recently published test is the 2007 K-CLASSIC, a computerized screening test of the intelligence and attention of children ages 6-10 years; the test was published directly for a French publisher and was adapted and published in 2010 in Germany.  My research and writing have centered on the clinical and psychometric interpretation of neuropsychological tests, especially different versions of Wechsler&#39;s intelligence scales.  I have authored or co-authored 22 books, including &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Testing with the WISC-R (1979), Assessing Adolescent and Adult Intelligence (1990), &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intelligent Testing with the WISC-III (1994), and--more recently--IQ Testing 101 (2009), Essentials of WISC-IV Assessment, 2nd ed.

My research program has been devoted to the psychometric and clinical interpretation of neuropsychological assessment tools (especially intelligence tests) and to individual differences on these tests within normal and clinical populations.  Topics that I have published on frequently include:  (a) the effects of aging from adolescence through old age on cognitive abilities; (b) the Flynn effect; (c) theoretical structure of clinical tests, especially from the vantage points of neuropsychological theory (Luria, Sperry), multiple-ability intelligence theory (Cattell-Horn-Carroll, or CHC), and g theory (Spearman); (d) individual differences on cognitive tests, especially based on gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and membership in various clinical groups; and (e) psychometric properties of intelligence tests, notably reliability, stability, and validity.&lt;em&gt;  &lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;

for Children (K-ABC) in 1983 and extending to the present day.  We are
currently in the tryout phase of developing the KTEA-III, a revision of the

the intelligence and attention of children ages 6-10 years; the test was
published directly for a French publisher and was adapted and published in 2010
in Germany.  My research and writing have centered on the clinical
interpretation of tests to diagnose learning disabilities, intellectual
disabilities (mental retardation) and other exceptionalities.  I have written many psychological case
reports that have been published in a diversity of texts, such as Intelligent Testing with the WISC-R (A.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey E. Indes M.D. is assistant professor of surgery and interventional radiology at Yale University School of Medicine. He completed his undergraduate degree in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics from the University of California Los Angeles. He then went on to receive his medical degree with distinction in research from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. His surgical training was completed at Temple University Hospital followed by his fellowship training in vascular and endovascular surgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center. He is a registered physician in vascular interpretation (RPVI), and currently the associate program director for the vascular residency program, as well as the founder and director of the Yale Vein Center and the Yale Vascular Laboratory. His clinical interests include all facets of vascular and endovascular surgery with a special interest in surgical education. His research currently focuses on outcomes in patients undergoing various open and endovascular treatment modalities for vascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine administrative databases are increasingly utilized to monitor outcomes in the healthcare system within the United States at statewide and national levels. These databases have been shown to be accurate at predicting the risks associated with certain surgical procedures. 1 The aim of our current work is to provide insight into the outcomes associated with endovascular procedures when comparing them to open procedures for specific disease processes, by utilizing both the New York State health department statewide planning and research cooperative system (SPARCS), the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS), and the Medicare databases respectively. 2,3 We are focusing on specific anatomical patterns of atherosclerotic disease such as chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI), aortoiliac occlusive disease, renovascular disease, femoro-popliteal occlusive disease and carotid artery occlusive disease, and compare the outcomes related to endovascular vs. open treatment within each disease category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By better characterizing the statewide and national trends in treatment of these disease processes and documenting morbidity and mortality associated with each, as well as the costs incurred with endovascular and open procedures, these treatments can be applied to the appropriate patients. In addition, although many prospective randomized control trials comparing open and endovascular treatment for carotid artery disease have been completed or are underway, 4-16 there are deficiencies in the performance of trials for: CMI, renovascular disease, aortoiliac occlusive disease and femoro-popliteal occlusive disease. Our results may provide solid support that these trials need to be performed. Finally, our results at the statewide and national levels with regards to the open and endovascular treatment of carotid artery disease can be compared to published data from multicenter trials and provide important information on the outcomes of these patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our preliminary work studying outcomes associated with CMI using the SPARKS database for the years 2000-2006 have yielded interesting results. We identified 6549 patients with CMI in New York State during the study period 2000 to 2006. Of these patients with CMI, 666 received an intervention and underwent either open (280) or endovascular (347) repair. Thirty nine patients underwent both treatments. Statistically significant comorbidities included a higher incidence of diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency and hypertension among endovascular patients, while gender and history of emphysema was constant between the two groups. During the 7 year study period; there was a continuous increase in the number of endovascular procedures, while the number of open procedures fluctuated. Twenty eight percent of the procedures done in 2000 for CMI were endovascular where as 75% of the procedures done in 2006 were endovascular. In addition, there was a 2 fold increase in the total number of interventions, when those done in 2000 were compared to those done in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall mortality rate for the 7 year period was significantly lower for endovascular vs. open repair (10.95% vs. 20.36%, p = 0.0011). Endovascular repair was associated with a significantly lower rate of ischemic complications of the mesentery when compared to open repair (6.92% vs. 17.14% p &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, compared with open repair, endovascular repair resulted in a significantly lower rate of cardiac, pulmonary and infectious complications. Within the open repair group 36.8%, compared to 55% of the endovascular repair patients, were discharged to home during the seven year study period (p &lt; 0.0001). The number of patients treated with an intervention for CMI continues to increase, due primarily, to the increase in the number endovascular procedures. Patients undergoing endovascular treatment experience improved morbidity, mortality and frequency of discharge to home. These data support the need for prospective randomized studies comparing clinical outcomes in patients treated surgically for CMI. (Published in JEVT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future directions include utilizing our administrative databases to examine specific cost and institutional analyses related to open and endovascular treatments for CMI, renovascular disease, aortoiliac occlusive disease, femoral popliteal occlusive disease, carotid disease, vascular trauma, aortic aneurysms and venous disease. By analyzing cost effectiveness as well as outcomes related to the type of institution a patient was treated in (high volume vs. low volume), results can help guide patient care, provide input on healthcare policy and suggest specific treatment strategies which are in need of further investigation through randomized controlled trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our current projects include outcomes in Traumatic Aortic Transection as well as Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms in New York State. Under the tutelage of Julie Ann Sosa M.D. in the Department of Surgery we are currently studying clinical and economic outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) utilizing the HCUP-NIS database. We are also interested in forming new research studying surgical education with focus on surgical skills utilizing simulation and measures of knowledge base.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My research in Dr. Lloyd Cantley’s laboratory (Professor of Internal Medicine at Yale University) had focused on hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a secreted protein that plays important roles in epithelial morphogenesis, mitogenesis, and motogenesis. We made the novel discovery that paxillin functions as a scaffolding protein that regulates the HGF-dependent activation of ERK at focal adhesions. In a follow-up study, we demonstrated that paxillin itself is a substrate to ERK-dependent phosphorylation, which recruits FAK and Rac and is necessary for HGF-dependent tubulogenesis. These findings were published as two first-authored papers in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Cell &lt;/em&gt;and are important because they elucidate the mechanism by which HGF regulates focal adhesion turnover, which is essential for cell spreading and morphogenesis. More generally, they explain how compartmentalization of MAP kinase signaling is achieved through local activation on scaffolding proteins, such as paxillin.  In a third study we observed that during &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; tubulogenesis, the cells located in the middle of the tubules appeared well differentiated whereas cells located at the ends had a mesenchymal appearance. We discovered that cell confluency modulates the responsiveness to HGF through its effects on the activation of Akt and beta-catenin. These findings were published in &lt;em&gt;MCB&lt;/em&gt; and are relevant to the mechanism of tubular regeneration after acute kidney injury, which we hypothesize involves HGF-stimulated cell spreading, proliferation, and dedifferentiation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After starting my own laboratory, we have focused on podocytes, the specialized epithelial cells that maintain the glomerular filtration barrier, and are critical targets in proteinuric disorders such as diabetic nephropathy.  My current research in podocyte biology is concentrated in two areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interest lies in the further understanding of cell-matrix biology in his study of podocytes.  When podocytes are injured, the foot processes undergo a term known as effacement, where the cells collapse losing cell-cell junction proteins resulting in proteinuria.  A mechanisms of podocytes undergoing foot process effacement likely requires cell spreading and motility which requires turnover of focal adhesion proteins, which acts as a“glue” to keep cells attached to its matrix.  To further address this hypothesis, a key focal adhesion protein, FAK, was conditionally deleted in podocytes taking advantage of mice genetics.  Generation of these mice resulted in resistance to proteinuria induced by various injury models. Moreover, as FDA approved FAK inhibitors are available, through collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals, treatment of mice with FAK inhibitors during injury significantly reduced proteinuria and histological kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second interest in podocyte biology is to evaluate the importance of various interacting partners of known human disease causing mutations that result in nephrotic syndrome.  Currently, we have identified a network of proteins that bind directly or indirectly to proteins that human genetic studies have implicated to be causal for nephrotic syndrome. Through mice genetics, loss of specific proteins in this network has demonstrated severe proteinuria, and podocyte foot process effacement.  Through collaboration with Dr. Pietro De Camilli, we have found that these network of proteins lie at the interface of endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton and now are in the process of expanding our understanding by determining critical factors that are being endocytosed in the podocytes. Hopefully these fundamental findings will lead to therapeutic targets in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       The future directions of my lab are to further understand cell-matrix biology and endocytosis in podocytes by using mice genetic models of disease.  Moreover, we are in the process of obtaining human samples to discover novel disease mutations, which may lead to further understanding of disease processes leading to nephrotic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>Embryonic and adult stem cells hold great promise for regenerative
medicine, tissue repair and gene therapy.  Embryonic stem cells
represent a transient cell population that exist during embryonic
development and can give rise to all cell types present in an adult,
while adult (somatic) stem cells are permanent cell populations
dedicated to homeostatic production of mature cells in tissues such as
blood, skin and gut.  All stem cells must be able to balance
self-renewal versus differentiation, regulate proliferation and cell
death.  Our long-term goal is to understand how cell-fate decisions in
stem cells are regulated at the molecular level.  We have recently
developed a functional genomics approach to identify genetic mechanisms
that control self-renewal in mouse embryonic stem cells. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This approach
utilizes short hairpin RNA (shRNA) loss-of-function techniques to
downregulate a set of gene products whose expression patterns suggest
self-renewal regulatory functions.  We have applied this approach to a
selected panel of candidate regulators and demonstrated that in
addition to previously identified Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 several other
genes are required for efficient self-renewal of ES cells in vitro
(Ivanova et al., Nature 2006).  We are currently extending this
screening strategy to genome-scale shRNA libraries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Embryonic stem cells:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;We have recently developed a functional genomics approach to identify genetic mechanisms that control self-renewal in embryonic stem cells.

Long-term HSC, the most primitive cell in this hierarchy, can give rise to all blood lineages and has unlimited capacity to self-renew.  LT-HSC produces short-term HSC which are still multipotent but are limited in self-renewal capacity.  ST-HSC differentiates further into lineage-committed progenitor cells which are responsible for the large-scale production of mature blood cells.  We have chosen global gene expression analysis in primary cells followed by functional characterization of candidate gene products as an approach towards the comprehensive identification of HSC regulatory mechanisms.  To date we have performed transcriptional profiling of fetal and adult HSC using microarray-based technologies and have defined sets of genes that are specifically expressed in HSC but not in more differentiated compartments of the hematopoietic hierarchy(Ivanova, Science 2002).  We currently study several candidate genes that are likely to function as key regulators of self-renewal and differentiation.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Our laboratory has investigates the role of potassium channels, as well as other classes of ion channels, in the short-term and long-term regulation of neuronal excitability. Our group was the first to demonstrate directly, using purified enzymes, that excitability of neurons is regulated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C and tyrosine phosphatases. As part of this work we isolated the genes for over fourteen novel ion channels and were the first to identify the “two-pore” family of potassium channels. Among the channels that our group cloned and characterized are Kv3.1b channel, which is required for high-frequency firing in many neurons and the  Slack and Slick genes that underlie Na+-activated K+ channels. Our work was the first to show directly that rapid changes in the phosphorylation state of ion channels and in the synthesis of new channels occur in vivo in response to changes in an animal’s environment.  Most recently, we have found that the Slack protein interacts with the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein FMRP and that human mutations in Slack produce very severe epilepsy and developmental delay. This is now a major focus of our laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Among tetrapods, urodele amphibians such as Mexican salamanders (aka axolotls) have the unique ability to regenerate missing lens, tails, jaws, and tails.  This epimorphic phenomenon begins with the closure of the wound via migration of the existing surrounding epidermis, which over the course of several days becomes an unique structure known as the Regenerative Epidermis (RE).  The RE is required for regeneration since its removal prevents limb regrowth; however, it is unclear if the RE plays a &#39;permissive&#39; or an &#39;inductive&#39; role in the generation of the undifferentiated cell mass (aka blastema) that accumulates under the RE.  We have recently identified 124 genes that are expressed 1.5x more highly in the RE relative to non-regenerating, wound healing epidermis. We are currently exploring several of these secreted and membrane-bound proteins to determine if they play an inductive role in cellular dedifferentiation (i.e., blastema formation).  If so, this induction of adult dedifferentiated cells could be considered a natural analogy to the generation of iPS cells in cell culture.&lt;/p&gt;In addition to our interest in regenerative medicine, we are also developing novel reagents, which will allow us to explore new areas in cell biology.  This &#39;chemical genetic&#39; approach uses biologically active natural products and de novo designed small molecules to identify critical components in intracellular processes. In the past few years, our efforts have focused on anti-angiogenic, antitumor and anti-inflammatory natural products.  More recently, we have explored the use of small molecules to control intracellular protein levels, either by inhibiting their degradation or by inducing their proteolysis via the 26S proteasome.  A goal of this research is to develop novel methodologies that would allow for small molecule control of the &#39;undruggable proteome&#39;.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;The main focus of Dr. Robin de Graaf&#39;s research is the study of cerebral energy metabolism and its relationship to functional activation in human and animal brains. NMR spectroscopy (proton, (inverse) carbon-13, oxygen-17 and phosphorus-31) is the most important tool in the study of metabolic processes and fluxes, non-invasively in vivo. Besides studying brain energy metabolism, a significant part of the research is reserved for technological and methodological improvements to the technique of NMR spectroscopy. These include methods for better water suppression, spatial localization, spectral editing, quantification, and shimming. Dr. de Graaf&#39;s current research focus covers areas that are all related to tackling the challenges and grasping the opportunities of MR at very high magnetic fields. Developing methods to achieve magnetic field uniformity throughout the human and animal brain are central to the technological innovation of his research. The problem of magnetic field inhomogeneity is tackled through dynamic shimming and through the use of novel electrical coil element arrays. 13C NMR methods have been pioneered at the Yale MRRC and part of his research is to extend those methods to achieve 3D coverage, higher sensitivity (through 1H detection), and higher specificity (e.g., GABA turnover detection).&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>My research has focused on
studying voltage-gated sodium channels regulation by accessory proteins and
phosphorylation, and the contribution of specific channels to electrogenesis in
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons under normal conditions and in inherited channelopathies.  Sodium channels are
heterotrimers consisting of a large pore-forming alpha-subunit
(referred to as channel), and smaller auxiliary beta-subunits.  Sodium channels are large polypeptides
(1700-2000 amino acids) which fold into four domains (DI-DIV), each domain
including six transmembrane segments, linked by three loops (L1-L3).  Nine alpha-subunits
(Nav1.1-Nav1.9) encoded by the SCN1A-SCN5A and SCN8A-SCN11A
genes, have been identified in mammals, and their expression is spatially-, and
temporally-regulated.  Different channels
activate and inactivate with different kinetics and voltage-dependent
properties, with six channels (Nav1.1-1.4, Nav1.6 and Nav1.7) sensitive to
block by nanomolar concentrations of tetrodotoxin (TTX-S), and three channels (Nav1.5,
Nav1.8 and Nav1.9) resistant to this blocker (TTX-R).  Because channel properties are cell-type
dependent and sodium channel properties can be modulated in a
cell-type-specific manner, we have developed methods to study these channels within
native neurons. 


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neuronal sodium channels, Nav1.3,
Nav1.6, Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9
have been intensively investigated because of their potential role in nervous
system disorders.  Specifically,
Nav1.6-Nav1.9 are the main channels in DRG neurons, and their altered
expression and modulation following injury or inflammation have been linked to
acquired neuropathic pain in animal models. 
Electrophysiological studies over the past decade from our group and
several other research groups have attributed specific roles for individual
channels to specific aspects of action potential firing.  Thus, in small-diameter nociceptive neurons Nav1.7
and Nav1.9 are considered threshold channels that boost weak stimuli and Nav1.8
is the channel that carries the main sodium current of action potentials with
Nav1.6 contributing to the first few spikes. 
In large-diameter DRG neurons Nav1.6 is the main sodium channel with
Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 present in a smaller number of these cells.  Recently, mutations in Nav1.7 have been shown
to underlie two distinct pain disorders, while its complete loss results in
congenital insensitivity to pain.  Ongoing
studies aim to better understand the contribution of these channels to the
pathophysiology of pain and other neurological disorders, including multiple
sclerosis and spinal cord injury.  

&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Using genetic, biochemical, and
electrophysiological approaches we have identified channel partners that may be
important for channel trafficking and /or modulation.  We have shown that members of the intracellular
fibroblast growth factors (FGF11-14) can regulate biophysical properties of sodium
channels Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.6 and Nav1.7. 
We have also identified and characterized CAP-1A, a cytosolic protein
which binds selectively to Nav1.8, among sodium channels, and induce
a reduction in the current density in DRG neurons.  CAP-1A also binds to clathrin, and may
represent a new class of adaptor proteins which link sodium channels and
clathrin and regulate sodium channel density by clathrin-mediated
endocytosis.  We have also reported that
contactin, a GPI-anchored cell adhesion moleculae, regulates the sodium channel
density of Nav1.3, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9, but not
Nav1.6 and Nav1.7. 
We are continuing this line of investigation to investigate
isoform-specific regulation of sodium channels by these, and other
newly-discovered channel partners.

&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Phosphorylation
of ion channels is a rapid and reversible that may significantly alter neuronal
physiology, and phosphorylation of sodium channels is predicted to acutely regulate
DRG neuron firing under pathological conditions.  It is well-established that tissue and nerve
injury cause the release of pro-nociceptive cytokines and growth factors, and
alter ion conductances, leading to sensitization and hyperexcitability of
nociceptive neurons.  For example, TNF-a, a major pro-nociceptive cytokine and other
pro-nociceptive factors including neurotrophic growth factor (NGF) activate
downstream signaling pathways including the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) p38 (stress activated MAPK) and ERK1/2 (extracellular regulated kinase),
a process which has been implicated in inducing hyperexcitability of injured
DRG neurons.  In fact, published work has
shown that acute application of TNF-a
to DRG neurons in culture increases the TTX-R current density in a
p38-dependent manner.  These results
suggest that Nav1.8 current density may be regulated by activated
p38.  We have designed experiments to answer the question of whether the Nav1.8 channel is
a substrate for direct phosphorylation by activated p38 MAPK, or whether
phosphorylation of the channel is necessary for the increase in current
density.  Additional studies aim to investigate the effect of p38 and ERK1/2 on different sodium channel
isoforms that are co-expressed within the same neuron.
&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;MAP
kinases are proline-directed serine/threonine kinases which phosphorylate SP or
TP sites in their substrates.  We have
identified several potential MAPK phosphoacceptor sites within cytoplasmic
regions of sodium channels, suggesting that they may be MAPK substrates during
pain signal transduction.  Using in vitro
kinase assays on individual channel fragments, we have now shown that loop 1
(L1), which joins domains I and II, carries a single p38 phosphorylation site in
Nav1.6 and two sites in Nav1.8. 
Interestingly these phosphoacceptor sites are part of a PXSP motif, the
minimal PXXP motif that binds proteins with SH3 domains.  Also PXpSP motif is a potential binding motif
of the type 4 WW domain of some ubiquitin ligases.  Thus phosphorylation of these sites within
Nav1.6 and Nav1.8 may act as a switch that permits binding or un-binding of
channel partners, leading to regulation of these sodium channels.  Indeed, we have shown that activation of p38
increases Nav1.8 current density while it reduces Nav1.6 current
density.  Our findings suggest that p38
directly modulates Nav1.6 and Nav1.8 in vivo, providing a rapid mechanism that can regulate nociceptive
neuron excitability following injury. 
Ongoing studies aim to elucidate mechanisms that underlie the
p38-mediated, isoform-specific regulation of sodium channels, and to
investigate the effect of p38 and ERK1/2 on other sodium channels within DRG
neurons.  

&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;While the role of sodium channels
in acquired channelopathies leading to neuropathic pain is well-established,
their role in inherited painful neuropathies has been less clear.  However, the recent discovery of a monogenic
link of Nav1.7 to pain disorders in humans provided a compelling
case for establishing Nav1.7 as central to pain-signaling.  Dominant gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene that encodes sodium
channel Nav1.7, have been linked to two severe pain syndromes,
inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD),
while recessive loss-of-function mutations have been linked to complete
insensitivity to pain (CIP). 
Electrophysiological characterization of these mutations has elucidated molecular
basis for altered excitability of DRG neurons that express these mutant channels,
thus establishing a mechanistic link to human pain.  

&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Pain in IEM is triggered by warmth
and is localized to the distal extremities (feet and hands).  IEM has been reported as early as 1-year-old
(early-onset), in the second decade (delayed-onset), and in adults
(adult-onset).  Although mutations in Nav1.7
have been identified in patients with early- and delayed-onset IEM, the
molecular basis of adult-onset IEM remains elusive.  Our studies have shown that all IEM mutations in Nav1.7 characterized
thus far shift activation voltage-dependence in a hyperpolarized direction,
allowing the mutant channels to open (activate) in response to a weaker
stimulus, compared to wild-type channels. 
At the cellular level, mutant Nav1.7 channels studied thus
far lower threshold for single action potentials and increase firing frequency
in DRG neurons, with all but one causing a depolarizing shift in resting
potential.  While pharmacotherapy for IEM
is largely ineffective, cooling is effective in relieving pain although
cold-induced injury is a serious outcome of this practice.  A recent study from our group, however, identified
a new IEM case in which patients responded favorably to the anticonvulsant drug
carbamazepine.  Surprisingly, while carbamazepine
blocked mutant and wild-type channels equally, it induced a depolarizing shift
of activation of the mutant channel, suggesting an allosteric effect of the
drug on the mutant channel.  

&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;A second set of mutations of Nav1.7
underlies many of the PEPD cases.  Severe
perirectal pain in PEPD along with skin flushing can start in infancy and
possibly &lt;em&gt;in utero&lt;/em&gt;, but with no
reported involvement of feet and hands.  While
seizures and cardiac symptoms may accompany PEPD, a link to the mutant Nav1.7
channel in sympathetic neurons, which normally express this channel, has not yet
been established.  As patients age, pain
extends to ocular and maxillary/mandibular areas and is triggered by cold,
eating or emotional state.  Our group and
others have shown that the PEPD mutations shift the voltage-dependence of
steady-state fast-inactivation of Nav1.7 in a depolarizing direction and, depending
upon the specific mutation, may make inactivation incomplete resulting in a
persistent current.  PEPD symptoms, in
contrast to IEM, are well controlled by carbamazepine; impaired inactivation of
PEPD Nav1.7 mutant channels could explain the favorable response of
the patients to carbamazepine.  At the
cellular level, we have shown that PEPD Nav1.7 mutant channels lower
threshold for single action potential and increase frequency of firing in DRG
neurons, but without altering resting potential.  &lt;br&gt;    

&lt;br&gt;Together with the published data that
have shown that Nav1.7-related CIP is not accompanied by other major
sensory deficits, except impaired olfaction, motor or cognitive deficits, our data
provide a compelling rationale to target Nav1.7 for the development of new pain
therapeutic agents which are predicted to have minimal side effects.

										<li>										<ins class='diffins'>&lt;p&gt;The focus of my lab is to determine the mechanisms of signaling by Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFRs) during development and disease conditions. We are currently pursuing three projects in our laboratory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project 1&lt;/strong&gt; involves the mechanism of FGFR signaling in craniofacial development. The mammalian skull is composed of 22 separate bones which grow at specialized joints called &#39;sutures&#39; to accommodate the rapidly growing brain during early development. FGFR mutations cause the premature fusion of cranial sutures prior to the completion of brain growth, a condition called craniosynostosis. We have made several animal models by &#39;knock-in&#39; gene targeting to explore the mechanism of craniosynostosis caused by FGFR-2 mutations that includes the first animal model for Crouzon-type craniosynostosis syndrome. We are exploring the FGF-responsive transcription factors and signaling molecules that are activated in cranial osteoblast cells using genomic and proteomic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Project 2&lt;/strong&gt; involves the mechanism of FGFR signaling in branching morphogenesis. FGFRs are expressed as two major isoforms, &#39;b&#39; and &#39;c&#39;. The b isoforms are expressed in epithelial cell layers, whereas the c isoforms are expressed in the mesenchymal tissues. While the c isoforms play a major role in bone development, the b isoforms play a critical role in the branching morphogenesis of organs. We are using salivary gland development as a model to explore the mechanism of FGFR signaling in branching morphogenesis. We are employing 3-D organ culture, as well as biochemical, cell biological and genomic approaches, to understand the process of branching morphogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Project 3&lt;/strong&gt; involves the mechanism of Klotho-FGFR signaling in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. FGF23 is the largest member of the FGF family and is produced by osteoblasts in bone, released into the circulation like an endocrine hormone and is able to regulate phosphate and calcium re-absorption in the kidney. FGF23 requires Klotho to signal via FGFRs to mediate its endocrine function. Klotho is a single pass type I membrane protein highly expressed in the distal convoluted tubules of kidney and interacts with FGFRs. However, which of the FGFR isoforms that Klotho interacts to regulate phosphate/calcium homeostasis is not known. Therefore, we are creating a genetic tool to identify FGFRs in the distal convoluted tubules of kidney that interact with Klotho and to explore the signaling mechanisms that are involved in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. &lt;/p&gt;</ins>

										<li>The innate immune system contains genome-encoded receptors that
provide a first line of defense to infection. Activation of innate
immunity triggers adaptive immunity. There are three classes of innate
immune receptors: &lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which sense agents in the
extracellular/vesicular space; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nod-like receptors (NLRs), which sense
microorganisms that penetrate the cytoplasmic space; and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RIG-like
receptors (RLRs), which recognize viral infection and trigger type 1
interferon production.    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We identified the TLRs for double-strand RNA
(TLR3), single-stranded RNA (TLR7), flagellar protein (TLR5), and
lipoprotein (TLR1/2). 
 Upon penetration of the cytoplasm, NLRs trigger
NF?B activation, interleukin-1 (IL-1) production, or apoptosis. In
humans, NLR mutation correlates with inflammatory disease. Nod2 carries
a leucine-rich repeat region probably recognizing bacterial muramyl
dipeptide, a nucleotide-binding domain mediating conformational change,
thereby enabling oligomerization between CARD domains of Nod2 and
downstream receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase, causing
activation of NF?B and antimicrobial peptides. NOD2
is mutated in Crohn&#39;s disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). Our Nod2-deficient mice were more susceptible to infection with
pathogens delivered to the gut, because of reduced production of
antimicrobial peptides. Thus, patients with CD may be unable to develop
an effective antimicrobial response, causing enhanced infection and
severe inflammation. 






 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Nalp proteins comprise a second arm
of the NLR family. We study several of these, including Nalp3 (NLRP3),
which senses infection or other stress that leads to K+
efflux and activates the &quot;inflammasome&quot; through oligomerization with
the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), enabling ASC
to bind to and activate caspase-1 to process pro-IL-1&#223; and other
substrates. 
 
 We found that multiple stimuli activate the Nalp3 inflammasome, including Listeria
infection. J&#252;rg Tschopp (University of Lausanne) showed that this
inflammasome recognizes uric acid crystals, explaining the inflammatory
properties of uric acid in gout. We found that alum, a crystalline
immune adjuvant and the only USA-approved human adjuvant, activates the
NALP3 inflammasome, which triggers macrophage inflammatory cytokine
production and adaptive immunity in vivo.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Disruption of the pathway
eliminates alum&#39;s adjuvant capacity. Likewise, particulate
environmental pollutants, including silica and asbestos, also activate
the Nalp3 inflammasome to cause devastating chronic inflammatory
disease. Thus, inflammasomes mediate anti-infective immunity,
immunopathology to environmental pollutants, and adaptive immunity. 
 The immune response sometimes reacts to
self-tissues, causing autoimmunity. How can antigenic stimulation of a
lymphocyte lead to such different outcomes? During an immune response
or in autoimmunity, the lymphocytes divide and differentiate into
effector cells. However, when immune tolerance occurs, the cell is
either inactivated or dies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are the decisions made to proliferate,
differentiate, be tolerized, or die, and how is this controlled?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Regulatory cells producing inhibitory cytokines are critical to prevent
autoimmunity. Of these, the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Treg
is the most studied. The functioning, generation, and maintenance of
regulatory T cells (Treg) are controlled by cytokines. Both
transforming growth factor-&#223; (TGF&#223;) and IL-10-family cytokines are
important. Mice lacking TGF&#223; develop autoimmunity to several tissues.
To elucidate upon which cells TGF&#223; acts, we expressed a
dominant-negative TGF&#223; receptor (dnTGF&#223;RII) on either T cells or
antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Mice displaying the dnTGF&#223;RII on T
cells recapitulate the diseases of TGF&#223;-knockout mice: autoimmunity and
IBD. In addition to autoimmunity, such animals have an enhanced
anti-infective response, better resistance to infection. Finally, mice
carrying the dnTGF&#223;RII on their T cells are resistant to tumors. Thus,
tumors use TGF&#223; to inhibit the antitumor T cell response; but if TGF&#223;
cannot act, immune clearance of tumors occurs. 
 To determine whether TGF&#223; controls innate immunity,
we expressed dnTGF&#223;RII using the CD11c promoter, which expresses in
dendritic (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells, both key mediators of
innate immunity. When innate immune cells cannot be inhibited by TGF&#223;,
both NK and DC innate, as well as adaptive, immune responses are
enhanced. CD11c dnTGF&#223;RII mice are also more susceptible to
autoimmunity, because TGF&#223; fails to control APC function. Thus, TGF&#223;
controls T cells, APCs, and NK cells. 
 We revealed additional mechanisms of TGF&#223; function
by studying conditional-knockout mice lacking TGF&#223;RII on T cells. TGF&#223;
is required for Treg homeostasis and function and TGF&#223;RII must be
present on a target cell for a Treg to be suppressed. We also found
that TGF&#223; controls the magnitude of T helper 1 cell (Th1) response by
setting the level of CD122 &#223; chain of the IL-15 receptor, which
controls the pool size of Th1 cells. Many cells make TGF&#223;. To determine
which TGF&#223; source is important, we first eliminated TGF&#223; on T cells,
using conditional targeting. Mice with T cells that cannot make TGF&#223;
also developed autoimmune disease and IBD, albeit slower than mice
lacking the receptor on all T cells. Thus, T cell–produced TGF&#223; is
important in immune response, but other sources must play a role.
Regulatory T cells that cannot produce TGF&#223; poorly control IBD, and T
cell–produced TGF&#223; is essential to generate Th17 cells, which mediate
disease in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. 
 T cells are activated and differentiate into
specialized effector cells. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;How is the effector pathway triggered that
is appropriate to the class of infection?&lt;/em&gt; We found the Th2 response is
activated when parasite antigen induces Notch ligand expression on
dendritic cells. This activates Notch in na&#239;ve T cells, which in turn
induces GATA3, the key Th2 transcription factor, by a Notch-responsive
promoter. Thus is a pathogenic signal converted to a signal for T cell
differentiation through Notch. 
 
 We identified cis-regulatory elements that are the targets of transcription factors, such as GATA3. In the interleukin-4 (IL-4) locus, the IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 genes are clustered, and several DNA elements within that region are important for gene expression. IL-4 gene regulation occurs through epigenetic mechanisms that target regulatory elements distal from the IL-4
gene. One of these elements is a previously unrecognized locus control
region (LCR) that is found embedded in the introns of the RAD50
gene in the cluster. This LCR, together with these respective promoters
and other cis elements of the locus, is in a preassembled complex in
na&#239;ve T cells that serves as a hub from which epigenetic changes in
histone acetylation and DNA methylation occur and enables rapid
response of the loci. 
 
 When na&#239;ve T cells are activated, both the IL-4 locus on chromosome 11 and the interferon-? (IFN-?)
locus on chromosome 10 are expressed almost immediately, despite the
fact that following differentiation these loci are never coexpressed
but instead are alternatively expressed in the Th2 and Th1 lineages,
respectively. To investigate this rapid coexpression, we examined the
physical relationship between these two loci on the different
chromosomes. The LCR of the IL-4 locus on chromosome 11 and the IFN-?
gene region on chromosome 10 are associated in the interphase nucleus
of the precursor cells but separate upon differentiation into effector
cells. Mutation in the LCR on chromosome 11 delays expression of the IFN-?
gene on chromosome 10. We find other such associations and further
evidence for their functional roles. Thus, regulatory sequences on one
chromosome likely control &quot;in trans&quot; gene expression on other
chromosomes. 
 Our laboratory retains a long-standing interest in
the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis. The program of cell death is
triggered through the activation of cysteine proteases called caspases.
Caspase-3 and -7 cleave similar substrates. Caspase-7–knockout mice
have only a mild phenotype, but the combination with caspase-3
deficiency results in embryonic lethality. Caspase-3 and -7 are also
required for upstream mitochondrial functions in apoptosis, via a
positive-feedback loop, in addition to their roles as effector
caspases.

Ebf1 deficient mice lack B cells but also have increased bone formation and increased marrow fat. Increased fat usually occurs at the expense of osteoblastogenesis. Because of the lipodystrophic phenotype of Ebf1 deficient mice, we are developing models for increased marrow fat. Marrow fat increases with age. However, is function as well as its origin are unknown. In a separate project, we are isolating cells from inside, rather than on bone surfaces.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Studies of the past decade have shown that many diseases ofneurodegeneration are the result of protein misfolding, and we havebegun to seek an understanding of the mechanism of such degeneration. We have focused on misfolding caused by mutant forms of theanti-oxidant cytosolic enzyme SOD1 (superoxide dismutase), that producean inherited form of ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), with progressive,fatal motor neuron dysfunction. We are using mice expressing mutant G85R SOD1-YFP, containing a mutant version of SOD1 unable to reach the native state, studying the transgenic animals with a variety of approaches, to investigate how the mutant SOD1 produces motor neuron dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have identified that there is a progression of misbehavior of mutant SOD1 protein itself in the spinal cord of transgenic animals. Initially it is soluble and associated to a significant extent with the abundant cytosolic chaperone Hsc70 (by contrast the wild-type protein does not form such association, presumably because it occupies the native state). Subsequently the mutant SOD1 protein begins to form both soluble oligomers (observable by gel filtration chromatography) and insoluble aggregates and at this point an additional molecular chaperone, Hsp110 becomes associated with the soluble form. At this point the animal exhibits mild lower extremity symptoms (weakness or pulling in when held by the tail) which progress over the next two to three months to lethal paralysis, usually commencing in the lower extremities. We are currently seeking to understand ultrastructural correlates of this progression using EM, analyzing motor neuron cell bodies in the spinal cord, sciatic nerve axons, and neuromuscular junctions. Where do abnormalities first present? What is the progression? We have used laser capture microdissection of motor neurons and RNA-seq from animals at mid-course in their progression to inspect for changes in transcriptional expression, but find only a small number of differences with wild-type SOD1-YFP motor neurons. Notably, there is no heat shock response, no unfolded protein (ER) response, but there are effects on several calcium binding proteins, and the level of Hsp110 mRNA is increased. We surmise that most of the toxicity of mutant SOD1 is exerted post-transcriptionally, contrasting with pathogenesis by other proteins implicated in ALS, such as TDP43 and FUS. At the post-translational level, using affinity capture and mass spectrometry, we find a variety of associations of the mutant protein in spinal cord, the most prominent being with the molecular chaperone, Hsc70. It remains to be seen whether other lower affinity interactions, that have gone undetected by affinity capture and MS, are crucial to pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mouse system we have also recently been able, in collaboration with David McCormick&#39;s group to carry out electrophysiologic measurements of MNs by patch clamping them in spinal cord of wild-type and mutant SOD1 mice in slice preparations prepared by MSTP student Muhamed Hadzipasic in our lab.  This has identified a vulnerable motor neuron that dies by the time animals are symptomatic.  We are further characterizing this neuronal type as well as conducting additional circuit-related experiments to analyze how the motor sytem adapts to loss of a motor neuron firing type. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also studying a heterologous system that reports on mutant SOD1-YFP toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ability to produce and purify the mutant SOD1-YFP protein from E.coli (as well as the wild-type protein) has enabled testing in other systems. One such system involves the axoplasm from the giant axon of the squid Loligo pealei, a system in which the transport of vesicles can be examined using videomicroscopy. We observe that adding mutant SOD1-YFP (but not wild-type) produces marked slowing of anterograde but not retrograde vesicular traffic. This occurs when monomeric forms of the mutant protein are added, but also when oligomeric species, first crosslinked and then purified by gel filtration, are added. At the same time as the mutant protein produces slowing of anterograde fast axonal transport, we observe that the MAP kinase cascade is activated by the mutant protein, involving ASK1 (MAPKKK) and p38 (MAPK). Remarkably, addition of molecular chaperones, and most potently, Hsp110, restores anterograde transport to normal and abrogates activation of the kinase cascade. In affinity capture studies, we observe that Hsp110 physically associates with the mutant protein. Thus it appears that there is a pathway in which the misfolded protein, if not counteracted by molecular chaperones, is able to activate a kinase cascade that inhibits anterograde transport, most likely via the phosphorylation of kinesin. We are now seeking to understand how the misfolded protein “links” to the kinase cascade. For example, does it directly interact with ASK1, or with another component that does so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further tests we are studying neurotransmission in the squid giant synapse, an axonal-axonal connection, injecting mutant SOD1 protein presynaptically and testing effects on neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;We have found that this activation takes place in a special cellular organelle that has features of both a lysosome and classic secretory vesicle. We are characterizing this novel compartment and the second messenger signals that stimulate zymogen activation and are focusing on the role of vacuolar-ATPases (vATPase) and organelle acidification. vATPase are distinctive proton transporters that are dynamically regulated by assembly and disassembly of membrane-bound and soluble subunits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have found that distinct protein kinases, such as AMPK, regulate the activation and inactivation of the vATPase. These studies have direct clinical implications. Thus, we have recently found that an acute acid load worsens pancreatitis responses in an animal model of this disease. Further, certain metabolic products, such as lactate may lessen the severity of disease. Finally, pharmacological agents that enhance the activity of AMPK may be useful for disease treatment and/or prevention. We plan to pursue these studies using rodents models of pancreatitis, human acinar cells, and to collobrate with clinical investigators to examine these pathways in patients. &lt;/p&gt;

Little research has focused on this trend, and the economic, social, and medical consequences have not been considered.  To close this gap, we are proposing to identify, recruit, and study a valid sample of injectors who reside in Connecticut suburbs using respondent driven sampling (RDS).&lt;br&gt;5 R01 DA023408-04 (Heimer)                                     &lt;br&gt;07/01/2007– 04/30/2012                             &lt;br&gt;NIDA &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Policy, Incarceration, Community Re-entry, and Race Disparities in HIV/AIDS (SHARRPP)          &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    The project analyzes the interconnections among drug policies in the US, the massive migration in and out of the criminal justice (CJ) system that these policies have created, and race disparities in HIV risk.&lt;br&gt;7 R01 DA025021-02 (Blankenship)                             &lt;br&gt;09/15/2009– 07/31/2014                             &lt;br&gt;NIDA &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Respondent-Driven Sampling &amp; Data Collection for Men Who Have Sex with Men&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    The study assesses the feasibility of improving representativeness of samples of MSM recruited online, a population at acute risk for sexually transmitted infections.&lt;br&gt;1 R21 MH090920-01A1 (White)                                   &lt;br&gt;01/01/2011– 12/31/2012                             &lt;br&gt;NIMH &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecticut Emerging Infections Program (CT-EIP)          &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    The Yale Emerging Infections Program, in partnership with the State of Connecticut Department of Public Health is responsible for carrying out surveillance for emerging and re-emerging infections of particular interest to the CDC, most notably foodborne, respiratory, hepatitis, lyme disease, and other infectious disease.&lt;br&gt;2009-0238 (Heimer)                                                     &lt;br&gt;12/30/2008– 12/29/2011                             &lt;br&gt;CDC &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Feasibility Study of Pharmacy-Based HIV Prevention: St. Petersburg&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    The study assesses the feasibility of using pharmacies as public health venues to provide HIV-prevention to injection drug users (IDUs) in St. Petersburg, Russia. This application is one of the linked R21 proposals developed by India,Vietnam, Russia and USA in preparation for a large-scale, multi-site randomized controlled intervention trial. The expected results of these studies will help to develop the training for the pharmacists to provide HIV- related services to IDUs as highly effective intervention that could be implemented in a wide variety of cultural settings. &lt;br&gt; 5 R21 DA027228-02 (Shaboltas)                                 &lt;br&gt;09/15/2009– 08/31/2012                             &lt;br&gt;NIDA &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol and HIV Risk Reduction in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation           &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    We are developing and testing a theory-based risk reduction intervention for men and women who drink alcohol, who are seeking VCT at STI clinics and are at risk for contracting and transmitting HIV in St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;br&gt;5 R01 AA17389-04 (Abdala)                                        &lt;br&gt;09/30/2007– 06/30/2011                           &lt;br&gt;NIAAA &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Center for Public Health Excellence in HIV Prevention in the Russian Federation &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    The primary aim of the projects are (1) setting up a scientific and methodological center for research and development to facilitate efficiency improvement of organizations engaged in HIV control and prevention in the Russian Federation, (2) analyzing previously collected biobehavioral and surveillance data, (3)conducting studies on HIV prevalence in IDU and bridge populations in two Russian cities, and (4) developing manuals and courses to teach research methods on these topics.&lt;br&gt;CRDF 47.079 (Levina and Heimer)                                        &lt;br&gt;6/15/2008- 3/31/2011&lt;br&gt;Civilian Research &amp; Development Foundation &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring and Evaluation of Program to Promote Youth Friendly Sexual and Reproductive Health Services in 8 CIS Nations          &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    The primary aims of this project are to provide the implementers of the program with the reporting tools to determine the impact of their efforts and to analyze the reports to inform the project funder (the government of Finland) of project accomplishments and failures. &lt;br&gt; UREC6R52A Heimer (PI)                                            &lt;br&gt;07/01/09– 07/31/11                                  &lt;br&gt;UNFPA &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training and Research in HIV Prevention in Russia          &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    This training grant continues to develop a cadre of researchers at four institutions in St. Petersburg thereby building capacity in Russian institutions to address their expanding HIV/AIDS epidemic. &lt;br&gt;5D43TW001028-10 (Heimer)                                      &lt;br&gt;09/30/98– 05/31/16    &lt;br&gt;Fogarty International Center &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA)          &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    Conduct research aimed at the prevention of HIV infection and reduction of the negative consequences of HIV disease in vulnerable and underserved populations.

										<li>&lt;strong&gt;Chromatin dynamics and epigenetic control in the immune system
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Chromatin
structure dictates whether a DNA template is accessible to nuclear
proteins, and is thus a focal point of gene regulation by signaling
pathways. External signals often mobilize &quot;chromatin remodeling
complexes (CRC)&quot; and histone modifying enzymes to reversibly
reconfigure chromatin, but the altered chromatin states can sometimes
be maintained and propagated to daughter cells after the cessation of
the signaling event. This latter effect enables transient signals to
heritably or &quot;epigenetically&quot; modify gene function without altering DNA
sequences, thus providing a molecular basis for cellular memory and
lineage differentiation. On the other hand, misdirected epigenetic
controls are now recognized to underlie many human diseases. For
example, during cancer development, tumor suppressor genes often become
inactivated by &quot;epimutations&quot; characterized by aberrant chromatin
rather than by classic DNA mutations. Epimutations also explain
phenotypic differences between genetically identical twins, between
cloned and original animals, and explain the high incidents of birth
defects in &quot;test tube babies&quot;. Epimutations that occur in the germline
can be transmitted across generations, which has been inferred from
epidemiological studies of human diseases and directly demonstrated in
animal models. Epigenetics has thus emerged as a new frontier in
biology, with far-reaching implications. Our long-term goals are to
reveal fundamental principles in chromatin biology and epigenetics, and
to define how such principles underpin the development and function of
the immune system. Below are some of the problems we are tackling: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do external signals mobilize CRC? The current dogma is that
signaling pathways impinge on CRC indirectly, by controlling
transcription factors which then recruit CRC to target genes via
physical interactions.
 Our recent data
indicate that the Swi/Snf-like BAF complex, the prototypical mammalian
CRC, is subject to a novel mode of regulation. Specifically, Toll-like
receptor (TLR) signaling in macrophages is found to activate the
ubiquitous signaling molecule calmodulin (CaM), which then directly
binds the BAF complex and stimulates BAF-dependent remodeling and
expression of target genes essential for the innate immune response.
Given that both CaM and BAF complex are ubiquitously expressed, this
novel pathway, connecting cell surface receptors to chromatin, should
operate in diverse tissues beyond macrophages and thus be of general
importance. We have also developed cell permeable peptides that can
effectively disrupt CaM-BAF interaction and block the innate immune
response in animal models. These inhibitors provide a powerful means
for dissecting and manipulating this novel signaling pathway, with
important implications in basic and clinical research. 
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Novel functions of the BAF complex. Although called &quot;CRC&quot;, the BAF
complex, like other CRC, carries multiple subunits totally dispensable
for remodeling in vitro. Our hypothesis is that the BAF complex has
novel functions in gene regulation unrelated to remodeling. To test
this, we have developed a general strategy to engineer tissue-specific
point mutations in mice. Our data confirm our hypothesis. So far, we
have found that the complex uses ATPase-independent activities to
stimulate CD4 expression and promote the survival of regulatory T
cells. We are studying the molecular basis of such mysterious functions.
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do transient signals trigger heritable changes in gene function?
The signals are thought to imprint on histones certain
posttranslational modifications or &quot;epigenetic tags&quot; which are
subsequently maintained and transmitted to daughter cells independently
of the initial signals. However, the identity of the tags and the
mechanisms of their self-perpetuation are poorly understood. We have
generated an animal model where transient exposure of mice to a drug
(doxycycline) triggers irreversible changes in the expression pattern
of a target gene that can be transmitted to future generation. We have
thus established the first animal model for transgenerational
inheritance of a well-defined gene. Preliminary experiments already
reveal an unexpected mechanism underlying such a mode of inheritance.

										<li>&lt;h3&gt;Current Research Program&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major goal of my laboratory is understanding the basic mechanisms that contribute to the establishment of orderly topographic maps within the CNS, during both normal development and during regenerative events following injury or disease. We have been focusing our efforts on the olfactory system, in part because of the complexity of the map between the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. Axons sort into 1,000 functional subsets that are targeted with high specificity to olfactory bulb glomeruli.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using both in vivo and in vitro models, we are currently isolating several mechanisms that may contribute to this complex reorganization including laminin, tenascin and the expression of putative odor receptors in growth cones. In related studies we continue to characterize a unique population of glial cells, ensheathing cells, found in the olfactory nerve. While elsewhere in the mature CNS glia are an impediment to axon growth, the ensheathing cell glia support axon extension and targeting throughout life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We recently demonstrated that the growth promoting effects of ensheathing cells are not limited to olfactory receptor neurons but are also seen in other populations of neurons. Particularly exciting, our recent studies demonstrate that the ensheathing cells remain pluri-potential and that when implanted into demyelinated spinal cord can adopt a myelinating phenotype which remyelinates the axons and contributes to a restoration of normal conduction velocities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel studies we are examining the molecular and synaptic organization of the olfactory bulb glomeruli. Using RT-PCR we are mapping the distribution of subsets of olfactory receptor cell axons in glomeruli to gain insights into the topography of odor-ligand maps in the olfactory bulb. In addition, working with colleagues, we are using a GFP tag to test hypotheses regarding the specificity of synaptic organization within glomeruli. Second, using antibodies synaptic vesicle related proteins and confocal microscopy we have begun to describe a hitherto unrecognized segregation of local and projection synaptic circuits in the glomeruli.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It may be that this segregation underlies the lateral inhibitory systems that are believed to be operative in the olfactory system. Beyond my colleagues in Neurosurgery, I maintain active collaborations with the following Departments at Yale: Neurology, Neurobiology, Anesthesiology and Ophthamology. In addition, I have collaborative studies with members of the faculty at Columbia University, Emory University, The Rockefeller, University of Maryland and University of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationship of Research to Neurological Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Increasingly, the neurological sciences are focusing on intervention strategies that will both limit the debilitating consequences of injury/disease as well as increase the probability of successful regeneration of pathways and connections in the CNS. In order to facilitate these processes it is necessary for us to understand the molecular and cellular events operative during axon extension, target selection and synapse formation. The studies described above directly assess those questions and, particularly in the case of the ensheathing cells, offer the possibility of clinical application in the near future.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My laboratory is engaged in a study of the pathophysiology of seizure foci in the brains of patients with epilepsy. Our work has concentrated on the molecular and cellular organization of hippocampal seizure foci in patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, who have this seizure focus removed in our epilepsy surgery program for the control of seizures. In the past our work has defined the anatomical and cellular organization of the hippocampal seizure focus in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our current work focuses on the molecular characterization these seizure foci through the use of high throughput techniques such as DNA microarray analysis and proteomics. The work completed using these techniques has focused attention on the molecular changes in reactive astrocytes at seizure foci, which appear to play a critical role in causing an excitable environment in the brain. Gene expression profiles in the blood of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy are also being carried out with the goal of identifying biomarkers of different subclasses of temporal lobe epilepsy and for predicting, prior to surgery, the outcome of surgery for controlling seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel with studies on human seizure foci, the laboratory is also developing and characterizing new animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy that better reflect the pathophysiological changes in human seizure foci. These translational studies are aimed at developing and testing new antiepileptic drugs and developing methods for seizure prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the laboratory was awarded an NIH grant for the study of proteomic profiles in human seizure foci (PI, Nihal de Lanerolle) and for the continued development of a new animal model of seizures (PI, Tore Eid). It also received an award from DARPA for the study of blast induced brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>Dr. Gilliam&#39;s research involves early childhood education and intervention policy analysis (specifically how policies translate into effective services), ways to improve the quality of prekindergarten and child care services, and the impact of early childhood education programs on children&#39;s school readiness. His scholarly writing addresses early childhood care and education programs, school readiness, and developmental assessment of young children. Dr. Gilliam has led national analyses of state-funded prekindergarten policies and mandates, how prekindergarten programs are being implemented across the range of policy contexts, and the effectiveness of these programs at improving school readiness and educational achievement, as well as experimental and quasi-experimental studies on the effectiveness of various methods to improve early education quality.

Dr. Gilliam directs The Edward Zigler Center in Child Development and Social Policy. Its mission is to create and disseminate research that can be used to inform legislative and other policy efforts on behalf of children and families and to train future generations working at the intersect of research and policy development. Dr. Gilliam actively provides consultation to state and federal decision-makers, and his comments on early education are sought frequently by national and international news reporters.

Additionally, Dr. Gilliam provides clinical supervision in the early childhood section of the Child Study Center (providing developmental evaluations of children birth to 5-years old) and in the Newborn Follow-up Clinic, for premature and low birth weight infants. Dr. Gilliam holds a joint appointment with the Psychology Department at Yale University.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Faustino is a patient-oriented researcher who focuses on improving the outcomes of critically ill children. He is currently working on the prevention of deep venous thrombosis and its complications in critically ill children. His goals are (1) to conduct multicenter randomized clinical trials because these are the studies that can provide the greatest impact on the prevention of thrombosis, and (2) to discover and validate biomarkers that may allow the development of a risk-stratified approach to the prevention of thrombosis. He is also studying the effects of controlling blood glucose in critically ill children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Faustino initially studied the impact of glucose dysregulation in critically ill children. He conducted observational studies that described the morbidity and mortality associated with hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in critically ill children. He is currently a co-investigator on a multicenter trial on the effects of blood glucose control in critically ill children.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Hirshberg, 2013 #7491&quot; href=&quot;#_ENREF_23&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Faustino is currently focusing his research on catheter-related thrombosis because the use of central venous catheters is the most common cause of thrombosis in children. He has conducted studies on the epidemiology of catheter-related thrombosis in critically ill children, completed surveys on thromboprophylaxis in pediatric intensive care units, and established collaborations with other researchers invested in the prevention of thrombosis. He is preparing to conduct randomized clinical trials that will test interventions to prevent catheter-related thrombosis in critically ill children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dr. Faustino has become interested in biomarkers because they may identify children at high risk of thrombosis. It is difficult to identify children who would develop DVT based on clinical characteristics alone. He has studied the use of blood glucose, clot strength and factor VIII to predict thrombosis in critically ill children. He is currently validating additional biomarkers that may identify children at high risk of thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Defining genetic factors contributing to IBD development. Genome-wide association studies sample a large fraction of common variation contributing to disease, but due to linkage disequilibrium patterns, typically do not identify causal alleles and/or rare variants contributing to disease. Comparative population studies provide insight into alternative mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. In addition, consideration of locus-locus interactions may provide additional power to define altered pathways contributing to disease pathogenesis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genotype-phenotype mapping. We are examining the functional effects of interleukin 23 pathway polymorphisms on leukocyte responses, with a particular emphasis on IL23R, IL12B, and PTPN2 polymorphisms known to contribute to IBD. In particular, genotype-dependent altered expression and function of IL23R in na&#239;ve vs. memory T lymphocytes are being examined. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biomarker development in IBD. The development and assessment of improved therapies in IBD will be significantly enhanced by improved biomarkers to assess disease activity based on new understanding of disease mechanisms, especially with respect to the interleukin 23 pathway.&lt;/li&gt;

In development, neurons form pre- and postsynaptic membrane specializations at sites of contact to assemble synapses. We know little about this critical process, in contrast to our understanding of structure and function of mature synapses. To address this question, we focus on the roles of SynCAM proteins. SynCAMs are a family of synaptic cell adhesion molecules that assemble into adhesive complexes at nascent synapses. They bridge the synaptic cleft and drive formation of new synapses. SynCAMs therefore are likely to act early in synapse differentiation. Our questions are first, how they demarcate sites of future synaptic specializations, and second, how synapse formation is coordinated across the synaptic cleft in time and space. In our studies, we employ biochemical, molecular biological, and optical imaging techniques. In addition, we analyze this process in vivo using mouse genetics.

To achieve this goal, we pursue three aims. First, we examine the role of adhesion and signaling molecules in CNS synapse formation. These experiments involve biochemical characterization of SynCAM, and the functional analysis of its extracellular interactions in cultured hippocampal neurons. Second, we determine the intracellular SynCAM interactions driving synaptic membrane specializations. Here, we purify and characterize intracellular binding partners of SynCAM from brain. Third, we analyze the site of SynCAM action in pre- and postsynaptic membrane specialization. This set of studies is conducted in cultured neurons, and also in genetically altered mice to manipulate synapse formation in vivo and to test effects on synaptic plasticity and brain development.</ins>

										<li>I have a
long-standing interest in the molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate
ion transport and protein absorption in the proximal tubule. An important goal
in our lab is trying to understand how these processes participate in renal
disease. Most recently, we have identified signaling pathways in the proximal
tubule that use a mechanism called regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP)
that is thought to link events at the plasma membrane with regulated expression
of specific genes. We recently showed that the proximal tubule scavenger
receptor megalin is subjected to RIP and which in turn inhibits expression of
specific brush border genes. In other studies designed to identify the
metalloprotease that mediates megalin ectodomain shedding we found that ADAM10,
a well known sheddase of other receptors (amyloid precursor protein and Notch) that
initiates RIP, colocalizes with megalin in the brush border. Additional studies
showed that, although ADAM10 is not the megalin sheddase, its activity does
regulate expression of specific brush border proteins (see Preliminary
Studies). We speculated that ADAM10 is part of an as yet undefined RIP-mediated
signaling pathway in the proximal tubule. Data provided from studies funded by
our current R21 (DK078710-01) show: (1) both the amyloid precursor protein
(APP) and the amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) are highly expressed in
kidney and in cultured proximal tubule cells where they colocalize with ADAM10,
(2) ADAM10 cleaves the ectodomain of APLP2 in OKP cells and, (3) physiological
studies of APP-/- and APLP2-/- mice show important
defects in kidney function (see Preliminary Data). Together, these data support
our hypothesis that ADAM10, APP and APLP2 represent elements of a novel
signaling pathway in proximal tubule that link events at the brush border with
gene regulation. We also emphasize that since RIP of APP is thought to play a
central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer Disease (AD) and because APP and
the proteases that mediate RIP of APP and APLP2 are therapeutic targets for
treating AD it will be important to understand how such therapies will affect
renal function in the AD patient.

&lt;li&gt;Transplantation-Based Approaches toward Remyelination &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Spinal cord injury can result in necrosis of the spinal cord, but often white matter tracts outside of the necrotic core become demyelinated.  In the absence of myelin, these damaged axons are unable to conduct nerve impulses just as if they have been severed.  Loss of myelin leading to impaired conduction also occurs in multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory disease of the CNS that alone affects approximately 35,000 US veterans today. Center scientists are investigating transplantation of myelin-forming cells into the site of injury as an approach to induce remyelination of demyelinated axons and thereby restore impulse conduction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategies for Neuroprotection following Brain and Spinal Cord Injury &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Secondary degeneration of neural tissue, initially spared but adjacent to irreversibly damaged tissue, can lead to further, and often, irreversible neurological damage after the initial injury to the brain and spinal cord, via a process of secondary injury.  We are studying a number of different approaches, both cell-based and pharmacological, that can limit secondary degeneration and preserve neurological function following trauma to the brain and spinal cord. &lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neuropathic Pain Syndromes Associated with Nerve and Spinal Cord Injuries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
One of the key disabling consequences of nerve and spinal cord injury is an excruciating form of pain called neuropathic pain.  It is brought upon by the reprogramming of injured spinal sensory neurons such that they become hyperexcitable, abnormally firing away electrical impulses when they should not be.  In over fifty percent of individuals with nerve injuries, neuropathic pain significantly impacts quality of life; existing medications are in many cases ineffective, or are only partially effective. We are investigating neuropathic pain, particularly the role of sodium channels and associated molecules/mechanisms in neuropathic pain, with the goal of identifying effective treatments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Molecular Basis for Restoration of Impulse Conduction within the Injured &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
CNSPatients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS experience symptom-free intervals that sometimes range in the order of years, despite the persistence of demyelinated lesions along their axons.  Such a recovery of function after injury to the brain and spinal cord, even in the absence of myelin, is called a remission, and it is due to a molecular reorganization within the axons such that transmission of nerve signals is restored.  The Center’s goal is to induce remissions in all people with nerve injuries and is therefore investigating the phenomenon of molecular reorganization in MS, particularly the reorganization of sodium channels which serve as molecular batteries in generating and transmitting signals along axons.

&lt;/ul&gt;
One of the key disabling consequences of nerve and spinal cord injury is an excruciating form of pain called neuropathic pain.  It is brought upon by the reprogramming of injured spinal sensory neurons such that they become hyperexcitable, abnormally firing away electrical impulses when they should not be.  In over fifty percent of individuals with nerve injuries, neuropathic pain significantly impacts quality of life; existing medications are in many cases ineffective, or are only partially effective. We are investigating neuropathic pain, particularly the role of sodium channels and associated molecules/mechanisms in neuropathic pain, with the goal of identifying effective treatments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Molecular Basis for Restoration of Impulse Conduction within the Injured &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
CNSPatients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS experience symptom-free intervals that sometimes range in the order of years, despite the persistence of demyelinated lesions along their axons.  Such a recovery of function after injury to the brain and spinal cord, even in the absence of myelin, is called a remission, and it is due to a molecular reorganization within the axons such that transmission of nerve signals is restored.  The Center’s goal is to induce remissions in all people with nerve injuries and is therefore investigating the phenomenon of molecular reorganization in MS, particularly the reorganization of sodium channels which serve as molecular batteries in generating and transmitting signals along axons.<ins class='diffins'> &lt;ul&gt;

Brueckner Lab:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Research Interests: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Development of vertebrate left-right asymmetry &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cilia in development &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cardiac morphogenesis

  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of non-random asymmetry along the left-right
axis is a unique feature of vertebrate development.  Defects in this process in mouse and man commonly affect the
development of the heart and result in severe congenital cardiac
anomalies.  The goal of my
laboratory is to understand the mechanism by which embryonic cilia create and
signal left-right positional information, and to investigate whether cilia have
essential roles in other developmental processes.




 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 


We have previously shown that the vertebrate
LR axis is initiated at the mammalian node late in gastrulation.  Dynein-driven motility of monocilia
found on node cells generates directional flow of extraembryonic fluid, termed
“nodal flow”.  The direction of
nodal flow is determined by the inherent chirality of the cilium itself, and
artificial reversal of nodal flow is able to reverse the LR axis.  Nodal flow sets up an asymmetric
calcium signal found in the cells at the left border of the node. The
development of LR asymmetry is also abnormal in mice with defects in the
polycystin gene Pkd2, which functions in kidney monocilia as a
mechanotransducer by mediating an intracellular calcium signal in response to
fluid flow in the renal tubule.  We
have shown that Polycystin-2 protein localizes to a subset of node monocilia
that are non-motile.  This data
suggests that embryonic cilia may be required to both create and sense nodal
flow.

 

The major foci of interest in my lab are currently:

  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How is the asymmetric perinodal calcium signal
transmitted to the developing organs to result in asymmetric morphogenesis? &lt;/em&gt; Calcium signaling is being investigated by live-imaging of mouse embryos with a range of mutations affecting cilia biogenesis and function.  To evaluate the relationship between perinodal calcium signals and asymmetric morphogenesis, asymmetric gene expression patterns are being correlated with calcium signals. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;At the cellular level, we are focusing on the inversin protein as a potential
transducer of the perinodal calcium signal.  Inversin is a highly conserved protein required for LR
development, and it has calmodulin binding domains that are essential for its
function in LR development. 
Studies are addressing the mechanism of inversin function in mice and in
cultured polarized epithelial cells. 
We are using time-lapse imaging of live mouse embryos with fluorescently tagged node cells to study the
potential link between perinodal calcium signals and migration of node cells.

  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the role of ciliary genes in human heterotaxy?&lt;/em&gt;

We are collaborating with the laboratory of Richard Lifton
in the Dept. of Genetics at Yale to perform a large-scale genomic analysis of
human patients with heterotaxy.  
Analysis of copy-number variation in a cohort of patients with Htx
identified &gt;40 novel candidate genes for human Htx.  These genes cluster in several
developmental pathways, some of which have not previously been linked to LR
development.  We are validating the
role of these genes in animal systems including mouse, &lt;em&gt;Xenopus&lt;/em&gt; and zebrafish, and beginning more detailed analysis of their function within the molecular framework established for LR development.

  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do cilia
play roles in cardiac development independent of their function in LR
development?&lt;/em&gt; 

Since
cilia function as mechanosensors in other fluid-filled organs they could also
be fluid flow sensors in heart development. We have shown that cilia are found
in the mouse embryo heart at e8.5 – e12.5, and that heart development in mice
with absent cilia is much more severely affected than in mice with paralyzed
cilia and isolated abnormalities of LR development. We are using mice with
conditional mutations affecting cilia structure and function to generate mice
with cardiac-specific ciliary abnormalities in order to investigate the
mechanism by which cardiac cilia function directly in heart morphogenesis.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Our research aims to identify and characterize novel mechanisms by which cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism is regulated. To date, most lipid and lipoprotein research has focused on alterations of protein coding genes, whereas the functions of non-coding RNAs remain largely unknown. Particular efforts are focused on microRNAs (miRNAs), a novel class of small non-coding RNAs that mediate port-transcriptional gene silencing. Using mouse models and cell culture studies, we will elucidate the molecular basis of the miRNA functions in regulating lipid metabolism and explore the potential of miRNAs as therapetic targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;miRNAs have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. miRNAs typically control the expression of their target genes by imperfect base pairing to the 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTR) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) thereby inducing repression of the target mRNA. Bioinformatic predictions and experimental approaches indicate that a single miRNA may target more than a hundred mRNAs. Indeed, human miRNAs are predicted to control the activity of more than 60% of all protein-coding genes. This class of short (22 nucleotides) noncoding RNA molecules has been shown to participate in almost every cellular process investigated so far, and their dysregulation is observed in, and might underlie, different human pathologies including cancer, heart disease, and neurodegeneration. Very recently, we have demonstrated that miR-33, an intronic miRNA located within the SREBP-2 gene, plays important roles in the homeostatic regulation of cholesterol metabolism. miR-33 inhibits the expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCA1, thereby attenuating both cholesterol efflux to apoA1 and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis. Conversely, silencing of miR-33 in vivo increased hepatic ABCA1 and plasma HDL. Because plasma HDL levels show a strong inverse correlation with atherosclerotic vascular disease, there has been intense interest in therapeutically targeting HDL and macrophage cholesterol efflux pathways. Our study suggests that antagonists of endogenous miR-33 may be a useful therapeutic strategy for enhancing ABCA1 expression and raising HDL levels in vivo. In addition, our recent preliminary data suggest that miR-33 also coordinates genes regulating fatty acid metabolism and insulin signaling. Therefore, we plan to continue investigating the potential relevance of miR-33 expression in metabolic syndrome. Moreover, we are working with other miRNAs involved in the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis, and depending on the results, would pursue the most promising candidates in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second major project is to characterize new genes involved in the regulation of cholesterol. A tightly controlled-but only partially characterized-network of cellular signaling and lipid transfer systems orchestrates the functional compartmentalization of cholesterol within and between tissues at the whole body level. Increased understanding of these processes and their integration at the organ systems level provides fundamental insights into the physiology of cholesterol metabolism. However several issues await further studies. For the most sterol transport processes, only a limited number of proteins that are involved have been identified and very little is known about cholesterol trafficking in many physiologically relevant cell types, such us hepatocytes, enterocytes or cells of the central nervous system. Future work will focus on determining the molecular mechanisms involved in the cholesterol metabolism in mammalian cells using functional genomic screens. Our current studies aim to identify new genes regulating low-density lipoprotein receptor activity and trafficking in human hepatic cell lines using a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens. Besides increasing our insights into the physiology of cholesterol trafficking, the information obtained should help to develop improved strategies for management of cholesterol-related pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>My
laboratory has focused on characterizing the translational autoregulation of
the folate-dependent enzymes, thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate
reducatase (DHFR). TS plays a critical role in the process of DNA biosynthesis
as it catalyzes the reaction which provides the sole intracellular de novo
source of thymidylate, an essential nucleotide precursor for DNA biosynthesis.
This enzyme has served as a target for cancer chemotherapy for well over 40
years and remains an active area of investigation. DHFR plays an essential role
in the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, which is the key one-carbon donor
required for de novo synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and proteins. This
enzyme has also served as an important target in cancer chemotherapy.

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Several
investigators had made the observation that exposure of cultured human cancer
cells, human tumors in in vivo model systems, and patient  tumor specimens to TS inhibitor
compounds, the best known of which is the fluoropyrimidine 5-fluorouracil,
resulted in an acute induction of TS enzyme and protein. Moreover, this
induction of TS protein appeared to correlate with the rapid development of
cellular drug resistance to these TS inhibitor compounds. Our laboratory was
the first to show that this induction of TS protein was mediated, at least in
part, by a translational regulatory mechanism. We went on to show that TS
expression is regulated by a translational autoregulatory mechanism in which TS
protein binds to its own cognate TS mRNA. While this process of translational
autoregulation has been well-described in bacteriophage and prokaryotes, this
was the first demonstration of translational autoregulation in a eukaryotic
organism. We have also demonstrated that dihdrofolate reductase (DHFR), is
regulated in a similar fashion. Thus, our laboratory has demonstrated this
relatively novel regulatory process in eukaryotic organisms for two different
genes, thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, and our laboratory is
considered one of the leaders, if not the leader, in this important field of
research (an important point to emphasize). 



&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Our
lab continues to focus on characterizing the molecular elements involved in
mediating the interaction between TS protein and its own target TS mRNA. We
have identified two novel cis-acting elements on the TS mRNA, one resides in
the 5’-upstream region and includes the translational AUG start site, while the
second element resides in the protein-coding region. Our work has involved a
dissection of the critical nucleotides and secondary structure that play a key
role in RNA recognition. In addition, we have recently shown using in vivo
transfection experiments that each element can function independently of one
another in controlling TS expression. However, it appears that both elements
may be required for optimal translational regulation of TS expression in vivo.





We
developed an in vitro selection methodology to further characterize the
critical nucleotide elements required for binding of TS protein to the TS mRNA.
This is a powerful method to identify nucleic acid molecules with high-affinity
binding for a wide range of targets including small molecules and proteins.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Using a completely random 25-nt oligoribonucleotide (ORN) library, we
identified a single RNA ligand that can bind TS protein with significantly
higher affinity (up to 20-fold) than wild-type TS RNA sequences. This
interaction requires the presence of a 3-nt stem-loop structure. In vivo
transfection experiments confirm that this selected RNA sequence requires a
functionally intact TS for its biological activity. However, in contrast to the
native TS RNA sequences previously identified which function as negative
repressor elements, this in vitro-selected RNA sequence appears to function as
an enhancer element in that its presence stimulates the synthesis of TS at the
translational level. There are presently two examples of enhancer elements
residing on the ferritin mRNA and hepatitis c mRNA. Thus, this is a relatively
novel finding in that the majority of the well-characterized cis-acting
translational regulatory sequences function as repressor elements. The importance
of this work is that it represents a powerful approach to characterize the
molecular basis underlying the TS mRNA-TS protein interaction. In addition,
such an approach may provide the rational basis for molecular drug design to
identify novel small molecules that can be used to inhibit and/or sequester TS
enzyme activity and function.



In
its role as an RNA binding protein, TS is capable of directly interacting with
other cellular RNA species in addition to its own TS mRNA. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Our lab developed a
novel immunoprecipitation-RNA:random PCR method to isolate cellular RNA
sequences that form ribonucleoprotein complexes with TS protein in human colon
cancer cells. Using this approach, we identified nine different cellular mRNAs
including those corresponding to the p53 tumor suppressor gene and the myc
family of genes. These studies suggested that TS may be involved in the
coordinate regulation of expression and/or function of these identified genes.
Since coming to Yale, our lab has focused on characterizing the biological
significance of the interaction of TS protein with the p53 mRNA, especially
since p53 has been shown to play a critical role in cell cycle control,
apoptosis, and as a key mediator of chemosensitivity. We have shown that TS
binds to a sequence located in the protein-coding region of p53 mRNA and that
this interaction results in translational repression, as determined by in vitro
translation experiments. In vivo transfection experiments using either a
tetracycline inducible system or a constitutive system where TS is overexpressed
in human colon cancer cells that express a mutant and functionally inactive TS,
show conclusively that overexpression of TS results in marked suppression of
synthesis of p53 protein with no associated change in p53 mRNA levels. Thus, in
the in vivo setting, TS directly binds to p53 mRNA resulting in translational
repression. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        As part of this work, our laboratory developed a novel
immunoprecipitation-RT:PCR method to document the presence of TS protein-p53
mRNA complexes in intact biological systems. 



 Further
studies have shown that the TS protein-p53 mRNA interaction results in an
inability of these TS-overexpressing cells to undergo cell cycle checkpoint
following exposure to a host of DNA damaging agents. They also have an impaired
ability to undergo apoptosis. Moreover, these TS-overexpressing cells with
impaired expression of p53 develop resistance to UV- and gamma-irradiation as
well as resistance to a host of unrelated anticancer agents including 5-FU,
adriamycin, purine analogs such as fludarabine, and the platinum class of
compounds. Thus, the regulation of p53 expression by TS may represent a novel
mechanism by which the property for pleiotropic drug resistance may develop.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Our lab is now in the process of characterizing the molecular and biological
downstream consequences of the interaction between TS protein and the p53 mRNA.



 Our
lab is focused on characterizing the molecular elements underlying the
interaction between TS protein and its own TS mRNA as well as the interaction
between TS protein and the p53 mRNA. These studies are of fundamental
importance from a basic biology point of view as they provide new insights into
the elements that mediate RNA-protein interactions and the process of
translational regulation. Moreover, they provide novel opportunities and
strategies to develop new approaches for the treatment of human cancer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As one
example, we are working with a medicinal chemist to develop novel small
molecules to optimally inhibit TS expression and function. As noted previously,
one of the potential problems with the class of TS inhibitor compounds
currently in clinical practice is that they result in the acute induction of
new TS protein, a self-defeating process. Ideally, it would be nice to develop
an inhibitor compound that would potently inhibit TS enzyme activity yet still
allow the TS protein to bind its target TS mRNA, resulting in translational
repression and inhibition of new TS protein synthesis. We have recently
identified 3 pyrrolopyrimidine lead compounds that appear to fulfill these criteria.
They do not seem to prevent the interaction of TS protein with target TS mRNA,
and treatment of human colon cancer cells with these compounds results in
sustained inhibition of TS activity with no acute induction of TS protein. We
are now performing a structure-activity relationship study of these lead
compounds in the hopes of identifying a candidate that can be eventually taken
to the clinic.

										<li>										<ins class='diffins'>        </ins>My
laboratory has focused on characterizing the translational autoregulation of
the folate-dependent enzymes, thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate
reducatase (DHFR). TS plays a critical role in the process of DNA biosynthesis
as it catalyzes the reaction which provides the sole intracellular de novo
source of thymidylate, an essential nucleotide precursor for DNA biosynthesis.
This enzyme has served as a target for cancer chemotherapy for well over 40
years and remains an active area of investigation. DHFR plays an essential role
in the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, which is the key one-carbon donor
required for de novo synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and proteins. This
enzyme has also served as an important target in cancer chemotherapy.

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Several
investigators had made the observation that exposure of cultured human cancer
cells, human tumors in in vivo model systems, and patient  tumor specimens to TS inhibitor
compounds, the best known of which is the fluoropyrimidine 5-fluorouracil,
resulted in an acute induction of TS enzyme and protein. Moreover, this
induction of TS protein appeared to correlate with the rapid development of
cellular drug resistance to these TS inhibitor compounds. Our laboratory was
the first to show that this induction of TS protein was mediated, at least in
part, by a translational regulatory mechanism. We went on to show that TS
expression is regulated by a translational autoregulatory mechanism in which TS
protein binds to its own cognate TS mRNA. While this process of translational
autoregulation has been well-described in bacteriophage and prokaryotes, this
was the first demonstration of translational autoregulation in a eukaryotic
organism. We have also demonstrated that dihdrofolate reductase (DHFR), is
regulated in a similar fashion. Thus, our laboratory has demonstrated this
relatively novel regulatory process in eukaryotic organisms for two different
genes, thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, and our laboratory is
considered one of the leaders, if not the leader, in this important field of
research (an important point to emphasize). 



&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Our
lab continues to focus on characterizing the molecular elements involved in
mediating the interaction between TS protein and its own target TS mRNA. We
have identified two novel cis-acting elements on the TS mRNA, one resides in
the 5’-upstream region and includes the translational AUG start site, while the
second element resides in the protein-coding region. Our work has involved a
dissection of the critical nucleotides and secondary structure that play a key
role in RNA recognition. In addition, we have recently shown using in vivo
transfection experiments that each element can function independently of one
another in controlling TS expression. However, it appears that both elements
may be required for optimal translational regulation of TS expression in vivo.





We
developed an in vitro selection methodology to further characterize the
critical nucleotide elements required for binding of TS protein to the TS mRNA.
This is a powerful method to identify nucleic acid molecules with high-affinity
binding for a wide range of targets including small molecules and proteins.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Using a completely random 25-nt oligoribonucleotide (ORN) library, we
identified a single RNA ligand that can bind TS protein with significantly
higher affinity (up to 20-fold) than wild-type TS RNA sequences. This
interaction requires the presence of a 3-nt stem-loop structure. In vivo
transfection experiments confirm that this selected RNA sequence requires a
functionally intact TS for its biological activity. However, in contrast to the
native TS RNA sequences previously identified which function as negative
repressor elements, this in vitro-selected RNA sequence appears to function as
an enhancer element in that its presence stimulates the synthesis of TS at the
translational level. There are presently two examples of enhancer elements
residing on the ferritin mRNA and hepatitis c mRNA. Thus, this is a relatively
novel finding in that the majority of the well-characterized cis-acting
translational regulatory sequences function as repressor elements. The importance
of this work is that it represents a powerful approach to characterize the
molecular basis underlying the TS mRNA-TS protein interaction. In addition,
such an approach may provide the rational basis for molecular drug design to
identify novel small molecules that can be used to inhibit and/or sequester TS
enzyme activity and function.



In
its role as an RNA binding protein, TS is capable of directly interacting with
other cellular RNA species in addition to its own TS mRNA. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Our lab developed a
novel immunoprecipitation-RNA:random PCR method to isolate cellular RNA
sequences that form ribonucleoprotein complexes with TS protein in human colon
cancer cells. Using this approach, we identified nine different cellular mRNAs
including those corresponding to the p53 tumor suppressor gene and the myc
family of genes. These studies suggested that TS may be involved in the
coordinate regulation of expression and/or function of these identified genes.
Since coming to Yale, our lab has focused on characterizing the biological
significance of the interaction of TS protein with the p53 mRNA, especially
since p53 has been shown to play a critical role in cell cycle control,
apoptosis, and as a key mediator of chemosensitivity. We have shown that TS
binds to a sequence located in the protein-coding region of p53 mRNA and that
this interaction results in translational repression, as determined by in vitro
translation experiments. In vivo transfection experiments using either a
tetracycline inducible system or a constitutive system where TS is overexpressed
in human colon cancer cells that express a mutant and functionally inactive TS,
show conclusively that overexpression of TS results in marked suppression of
synthesis of p53 protein with no associated change in p53 mRNA levels. Thus, in
the in vivo setting, TS directly binds to p53 mRNA resulting in translational
repression. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        As part of this work, our laboratory developed a novel
immunoprecipitation-RT:PCR method to document the presence of TS protein-p53
mRNA complexes in intact biological systems. 



 Further
studies have shown that the TS protein-p53 mRNA interaction results in an
inability of these TS-overexpressing cells to undergo cell cycle checkpoint
following exposure to a host of DNA damaging agents. They also have an impaired
ability to undergo apoptosis. Moreover, these TS-overexpressing cells with

										<li>&lt;strong&gt;Yale Center for Asthma and Airways Disease (YCAAD) Research Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yale-New Haven Hospital is the largest referral center in the state and YCAAD is the only dedicated adult asthma center in the region.  This active, rapidly growing center receives over 3000 visits a year and is the hub of the clinical/translational research program at Yale. Dr. Geoffrey Chupp, has directed YCAAD and developed a clinical research protocol, The Mechanisms and Mediators of Asthma and COPD (HIC 12268), that has recruited over 400 airway disease subjects to donate specimens to the YCAAD sample repository and participate in YCAAD research activities.  The evolution of this research protocol, dovetailed with the clinical program, is a unique system that efficiently recruits subjects into clinical study protocols.  These subjects have been recruited in YCAAD and are drawn from a large population of patients that continue to visit the center on a regular basis for long term care of their asthma.  This allows for repeat sampling, thus enabling our active pursuit of longitudinal studies. In addition, many of these patients are seen during exacerbations in YCAAD or Yale-New Haven Hospital where exacerbation samples can be taken.  From this protocol has grown a large sample repository of clinical and physiologic data, DNA, plasma and lung specimens from asthmatics that are stable or flaring (including the intensive care unit). All of this data is uploaded into a web-based database so that information enters the system in real-time.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YKL-40 Expression is Elevated in the Circulation and Lung of Severe Asthmatics&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once we had established the YCAAD research protocol and recruited an adequate number of patients, we began to search for clinically-practical biomarkers for asthma, focusing on the chitinase-like protein, YKL-40, based on the fact that its murine homologue is induced by interleukin (IL)-13 and it is measurable in the serum.  We hypothesized that YKL-40 expression would be increased in asthmatics compared to normal individuals. We also hypothesized, although asthma is traditionally considered an organ-specific disease, that YKL-40 levels in the peripheral circulation would discriminate asthmatic severity.   YKL-40 was readily appreciated in the serum from normal volunteers and was significantly higher in the serum from asthmatics [median (interquartile range) 58.3 ng/ml (40.0-73.3) versus 69.7 (40.0-107.1), P=0.02].   Importantly, YKL-40 levels increased with disease severity, with the highest levels observed in refractory asthmatics, compared to moderate and mild asthmatics, respectively (P for trend = 0.003).  The median (interquartile range) YKL-40 level in mild asthmatics was 49.11 ng/ml (36.7-94.2), 68.43 ng/ml (38.0-88.0) in moderate asthmatics, and 77.0  (44.6-158.4) in severe asthmatics.  &lt;br&gt;Based on the findings above, it was clear that circulating YKL-40 levels are elevated in asthmatics and, importantly, in severe asthmatics.  The levels of YKL-40 also correlated with the expression in the lung and physiologic and pathologic measurements of airway remodeling.  This suggested an important role for YKL-40 in the pathobiology of asthma, however, it remained unclear where YKL-40 played its part in the causal pathway and/or does it play a role in modulation of the asthmatic inflammatory response?  To address this critical question in humans we hypothesized that genetic variation in the YKL-40 gene (CHI3L1) would influence circulating YKL-40 levels and would be associated with asthma. We thus pursued studies in collaboration with Dr. Carole Ober at the University of Chicago.  In these studies, three additional asthma populations were examined, a well characterized founder population of European descent--the Hutterites (a related 13-generation, 1,623-person pedigree), 3 outbred Caucasian populations from the Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) birth cohort study, and 2 outbred asthma case-control populations from Freiberg Germany, and Chicago.  These studies confirmed our findings in the YCAAD cohort and demonstrated that a polymorphism in the core promoter region of the CHI3L1 gene is associated with YKL-40 levels and with asthma, lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.     Now that we have confirmed that CHI3L1 is important in the pathogenesis of asthma, through the molecular phenotyping of lung disease grant Dr. Chupp is the Principle Investigator of, we will begin to dissected the pathobiologic differences in gene expression between individuals with different CHI3L1/YKL-40 genotypes and phenotypes and the impact that these changes have on the risk of asthma and asthma severity.  Below is a brief description of the recently awarded phenotyping grant that will study 200 asthmatics for the next two years and will simultaneously measure genome-wide expression of genes in the blood and induced sputum using novel techniques developed in Dr. Chupp’s lab.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Molecular Phenotpying in Asthma Severity and role of Chitinase-3-Like-1 and YKL-40 Genotypes/Phenotypes (RO1-08-006)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have developed a detailed clinical protocol and will be bringing patients into YCAAD for simultaneous blood and induced sputum sampling with a goal of furthering our understanding of severe asthma and the role of chitinases in asthma.  Thus far, the human studies showed that YKL-40 is expressed in exaggerated quantities in the serum of asthma and correlates positively with asthma severity and airway remodeling, but inversely with lung function in multiple asthma populations.  The genetic studies demonstrated that YKL-40 levels are associated with a functional polymorphism in the promoter of the CHI3L1 gene and with asthma status, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and inversely with lung function. Therefore, YKL-40 is not only elevated in asthma, but also appears to part of the pathogenesis of asthma, at least in some patients.  Another important observation we have made from these data is that the rs4950928 CC genotype is associated with the highest levels of circulating YKL-40 and nearly all these individuals are severe asthmatics.  Furthermore, the frequency of the CC genotype increases with greater asthma severity.  Lastly, using a strategy outlined in this proposal to evaluate gene transcription in the circulation, we have found (consistent with all our other results) that CHI3L1 gene expression is elevated in peripheral blood cells in asthmatics compared to controls and that GWAS analysis of individuals with high expression levels of CHI3L1 have identified a number of novel genetic associations will be investigated/validated with collaborators in other asthma populations.  We have also demonstrated that relatively small changes in protein and gene expression in the circulation, while at first glance may seem unimportant biologically, when properly validated can identify novel molecules related to asthma pathogenesis.  We believe that examining asthma severity using a similar strategy (relative to rs4950928 genotype, YKL-40 levels) will define unique expression profiles, molecules, and polymorphisms that will define specific phenotypes of asthma severity.

										<li>										&lt;strong&gt;Yale Center for Asthma and Airways Disease (YCAAD) Research Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yale-New Haven Hospital is the largest referral center in the state and YCAAD is the only dedicated adult asthma center in the region.  This active, rapidly growing center receives over 3000 visits a year and is the hub of the clinical/translational research program at Yale. Dr. Geoffrey Chupp, has directed YCAAD and developed a clinical research protocol, The Mechanisms and Mediators of Asthma and COPD (HIC 12268), that has recruited over 400 airway disease subjects to donate specimens to the YCAAD sample repository and participate in YCAAD research activities.  The evolution of this research protocol, dovetailed with the clinical program, is a unique system that efficiently recruits subjects into clinical study protocols.  These subjects have been recruited in YCAAD and are drawn from a large population of patients that continue to visit the center on a regular basis for long term care of their asthma.  This allows for repeat sampling, thus enabling our active pursuit of longitudinal studies.

The second project is on Monte Carlo investigation of stereotactic radiosurgery of spinal metastases. The third project studies the testicular doses deposited by kVCBCT on prostate cancer patients undergoing IGRT. The fourth is on kVCBCT imaging doses to pediatric cancer patients. The fifth project is on personalized assessment of kVCBCT doses during IGRT of pediatric patients. The sixth project is on the red bone marrow doses from kVCBCT scans and the associated leukemia risk. Their works help the clinicians worldwide make informed decision on IGRT applications, potentially improving radiation safety in medical imaging of both adult and pediatric patients, which is highly aligned with the missions of the campaigns of Image Gently for children and Image Wisely for adults.

Our work has focused on children in the child welfare, mental health and juvenile justice systems. Some of these children are vulnerable for abuse, neglect, and abandonment or affected by parental drug addiction, chronic physical or mental illness, mental retardation and homelessness. Others suffer from their own serious psychiatric and behavioral disorders, often the result of the interaction between their own genetic imprint and chronic and pervasive stress, secondary to continuous exposure to neglect, violence and deprivation.

&lt;li&gt;My colleagues and I are currently engaged in a randomized study of the
Intensive In-Home Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service (IICAPS) a
standardized treatment model for children with serious emotional
disturbances and their families that is now being replicated in 17
sites within Connecticut. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have also implemented two new models of
treatment for children affected by parental substance abuse. Family
Based Recovery, (FBR) is designed to address both the parent and child
relationship in a developmental context and to provide
reinforcement-based substance abuse treatment for parents who are
active users. FBR has been replicated in 5 additional sites throughout
the state. SAFE Families offers drug and mental health treatment for
families from which a child has been removed. In collaboration with
Advanced Behavioral Health it aims to promote reunification and
permanency. &lt;/li&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;There have been three major foci to my developing program of research: understanding processes of recovery in psychosis; developing and evaluating community-based and psychosocial interventions to promote recovery, and; designing and analyzing policies to foster community integration among people with psychosis. First, in collaboration with John Strauss I was able to articulate, develop, and apply empirical-qualitative methods to the study of psychosis and processes of recovery. Initially through a series of longitudinal interviews with people living with, and at times recovering from, psychosis I identified a number of common elements in the processes involved in improvement. These findings led to a series of papers beginning in 1992 in which my colleagues and I described the various roles the person with the disorder can play in his or her own recovery as well as in the recovery of his or her peers. Primary among the elements involved in these processes were (re-) establishing a sense of efficacy as a social agent and a sense of belonging among one&#39;s non-disabled peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These appeared to provide cornerstones of recovery, especially for a population that had developed a secondary disability due to prolonged symptoms, impairment, demoralization, and social isolation. Beginning in 1995, we then began to apply these insights, through a participatory research approach, in the development and evaluation of psychosocial interventions designed collaboratively with people with prolonged psychosis. Through studies of individual and groups forms of peer support, we identified a number of potential avenues of access for people with disabilities to exit the psychiatric ghettos of community-based systems of care and return to the broader community. This research initially was taken up by the Mental Health Consumer Movement both in the U.S. and elsewhere, and then began to impact clinical psychiatry when we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing participants&#39; social functioning and decreasing their use of intensive and costly services. These studies also have since served as the impetus for large-scale, controlled studies funded by the National Institutes of Health and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration assessing the effectiveness of peer-based and culturally-responsive interventions in increasing access to care and improving functional outcomes among people with psychosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On somewhat of a parallel track, my work in public policy has been devoted to developing systems of care that promote the recovery and community integration of people with psychiatric disabilities. These efforts at the local, state, and federal level have involved introducing evidence-based, recovery-oriented, and culturally responsive services and structures across systems of care, and evaluating their effectiveness in improving patient and service system outcomes. Examples of our contributions include peer engagement as an alternative to mandated outpatient treatment and the use of psychiatric advance directives to extend a person&#39;s capacity to make his or her own healthcare-related decisions during times of distress or disorganization.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>										&lt;p&gt;There have been three major foci to my developing program of research: understanding processes of recovery in psychosis; developing and evaluating community-based and psychosocial interventions to promote recovery, and; designing and analyzing policies to foster community integration among people with psychosis. First, in collaboration with John Strauss I was able to articulate, develop, and apply empirical-qualitative methods to the study of psychosis and processes of recovery. Initially through a series of longitudinal interviews with people living with, and at times recovering from, psychosis I identified a number of common elements in the processes involved in improvement. These findings led to a series of papers beginning in 1992 in which my colleagues and I described the various roles the person with the disorder can play in his or her own recovery as well as in the recovery of his or her peers. Primary among the elements involved in these processes were (re-) establishing a sense of efficacy as a social agent and a sense of belonging among one&#39;s non-disabled peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These appeared to provide cornerstones of recovery, especially for a population that had developed a secondary disability due to prolonged symptoms, impairment, demoralization, and social isolation. Beginning in 1995, we then began to apply these insights, through a participatory research approach, in the development and evaluation of psychosocial interventions designed collaboratively with people with prolonged psychosis. Through studies of individual and groups forms of peer support, we identified a number of potential avenues of access for people with disabilities to exit the psychiatric ghettos of community-based systems of care and return to the broader community. This research initially was taken up by the Mental Health Consumer Movement both in the U.S. and elsewhere, and then began to impact clinical psychiatry when we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing participants&#39; social functioning and decreasing their use of intensive and costly services. These studies also have since served as the impetus for large-scale, controlled studies funded by the National Institutes of Health and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration assessing the effectiveness of peer-based and culturally-responsive interventions in increasing access to care and improving functional outcomes among people with psychosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On somewhat of a parallel track, my work in public policy has been devoted to developing systems of care that promote the recovery and community integration of people with psychiatric disabilities. These efforts at the local, state, and federal level have involved introducing evidence-based, recovery-oriented, and culturally responsive services and structures across systems of care, and evaluating their effectiveness in improving patient and service system outcomes. Examples of our contributions include peer engagement as an alternative to mandated outpatient treatment and the use of psychiatric advance directives to extend a person&#39;s capacity to make his or her own healthcare-related decisions during times of distress or disorganization.&lt;/p&gt;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;ul&gt;

Seen most commonly in children, they can disrupt school and attention performance.  The mechanisms for impaired attention in absence epilepsy are not known. To determine how brain networks are affected by absence seizures we perform simultaneous fMRI and EEG recordings in children during absence seizures. We also test attention both during seizures and under normal conditions. Our work has revealed abnormal activity in specific brain regions which may serve as new targets for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuronal Activity and Neuroimaging in Generalized Seizures&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Are “generalized” seizures truly generalized? Our work using high field (9.4-11.7T)fMRI and electrophysiology recordings from animal models suggests that s ocalled generalized absence and tonic-clonic seizures are in fact localized to specific bilateral cortical-subcortical networks. These findings may help develop targeted therapies with better efficacy and fewer side effects. In addition our direct recordings of neuronal electrical activity improve the interpretation of indirect neuroimaging measurements of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impaired Consciousness inTemporal Lobe Epilepsy&lt;br&gt;Temporal lobe seizures are the most common form of localized epilepsy. How do focal seizures impair consciousness?  We propose a “network inhibition hypothesis” in which temporal lobe seizures inhibit subcortical arousal systems, causing depressed cortical function.  In support of this hypothesis, we found sleep-like changes in the cortex with intracranial EEG and SPECT during temporal lobe seizures. We are now using high field (9.4 T, 11.7 T) fMRI,single neuron recordings, neurotransmitter studies, and optogenetic techniques in animal models to reveal the fundamental mechanisms of these changes, and to test novel treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Reality Driving Safety and other BedsideTesting in Epilepsy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One of the most devastating effects of altered consciousness in epilepsy is impaired driving safety. To determine how epileptic seizures affect performance, we use virtual-reality driving simulation during video/EEG monitoring while patients are in the hospital.  In addition, we have developed a prospective bedside testing battery, the Responsiveness in Epilepsy Scale (RES).  These testing methods provide better information to patients and physicians making decisions about driving, and may help identify brain areas crucial for impaired consciousness in epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Advances in Epilepsy Surgery Localization&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Some patients have seizures that are so severe that they cannot be controlled by medicine.  Many of these patients can be cured if we can identify a specific damaged region of the brain that can safely be removed and prevent the triggering of their seizures.  We have recently developed novel approaches to target surgery to the correct location in the brain, including:(i) 3D color movies of the “brainwave” electroencephalogram (EEG) in patients with epilepsy show where the seizures start, making safe and effective surgery much more feasible; (ii) innovative methods using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) tracers can pinpoint the region of seizure onset for surgical planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventing Epilepsy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One crucial goal is the prevention of epilepsy before it even begins.  We found in a genetic form of epilepsy that if we treat rat pups with anti-seizure medication from a very early age (even before seizures started) we greatly reduce their tendency to have seizures as adults.  In addition, we found in a recent review of human studies of the same form of epilepsy that early and effective treatment may improve long-term outcome.  This is a paradigm shift from current treatment strategies which view seizure medications as suppressing the symptoms, not the underlying disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also raise the hope that as genes are identified and enable epilepsy to be predicted, beneficial treatments may be started even before symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;</ins>

Lyme borreliosis is an infectious disease caused by the
tick-transmitted spirochete &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;.  Since its recognition in the United States in the early
1970’s, it has emerged as the most common vector-borne disease in North America
and a significant health care concern, with nearly 30,000 confirmed new cases
in 2009.  The infection can present
with a localized skin rash at the site of tick bite or with involvement of
other organ systems, especially the heart, joints and nervous system.  Although the infection is highly
responsive to antibiotic therapy when detected early, the time to symptom
resolution may be protracted.  A
delay in diagnosis can result in disease manifestations, such as arthritis,
that persist despite antibiotics effective at earlier stages of the illness.

 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My laboratory used the murine model of Lyme borreliosis to
study the host immune response to &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; in an effort to understand factors
that influence clearance of the organism and disease expression.  Our published work has demonstrated the
importance of innate immunity, especially phagocytes and T cell independent antibody,
in control of pathogen burden and the role of IgG subtypes and Fc receptors in
severity of arthritis.  Through
imaging modalities, we have begun to dissect the role of spirochete motility
and fluidity of its outer membrane in evasion of the innate and adaptive immune
responses.  In collaboration with
Dr. Eric Dufresne (Yale Department of Engineering), we are using optical
tweezers and speckle microscopy to measure the mobility of proteins in the
spirochete outer membrane and the consequences of membrane fluidity on the
ability of phagocytes to capture and ingest &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;.  In vivo, we are using multiphoton
microscopy to measure in real time the speed and motility patterns of
spirochetes as they move between the tick and the mammal, and the requirement
for select B. burgdorferi proteins in this process.  Using this system, we have also shown that the vast majority
of spirochetes are eliminated within the first few days of antibiotic therapy
for disseminated Lyme borreliosis, but antigenic debris can persist in tissue
adjacent to cartilaginous structures. 
Our current studies are designed to investigate the duration of
persistence of this debris and the potential for it to incite inflammation,
which may contribute to persistent symptoms after treatment for Lyme disease.

 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to pathogenesis studies, we are also working in
conjunction with L2 Diagnostics, Inc., to improve the diagnosis of Lyme
disease.  We have identified panels
of &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; antigens expressed at early and late stages of infection that
are underrepresented in lysates of cultured spirochetes, which are the
substrates of current serologic tests for Lyme disease.  These antigens are being evaluated for use
as new antigens for diagnosing Lyme disease and for evaluating response to
therapy.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bogan’s laboratory studies molecular mechanisms controlling GLUT4 glucose transporter targeting in adipose and muscle cells.  In cell types, insulin stimulates glucose uptake by translocating GLUT4 from intracellular membranes to the cell surface.  Understanding how this occurs has been a longstanding puzzle.  Dr. Bogan and his coworkers identified a protein complex that sequesters GLUT4 in nonendosomal, intracellular vesicles in the absence of insulin.  Insulin then acts on this complex to mobilize GLUT4 to the cell surface.  This action is coordinated with other insulin signals that act on GTPases to direct vesicle targeting.  Current work is directed to understand the biochemical mechanisms involved in this response, including phosphorylation, GTPase signaling, and ubiquitin-like modification pathways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much current work in the laboratory focuses on a proteolytic mechanism that regulates glucose uptake in fat and muscle.  Previous work identified the TUG protein as a critical regulator of GLUT4 targeting, which limits cell-surface GLUT4 and glucose uptake in cells not stimulated with insulin.  TUG traps GLUT4 in non-endosomal vesicles, bound at the Golgi matrix, and insulin triggers endoproteolytic cleavage of TUG to liberate these vesicles for translocation to the cell surface.  GLUT4 and other vesicle cargos are then maintained at the cell surface by cycling through endosomes, and they bypass a TUG-regulated compartment until insulin signaling is terminated, and the cargos are re-sequestered.  This arrangement obviates the need for ongoing TUG cleavage during sustained insulin exposure.  TUG cleavage generates a product that functions as a novel ubiquitin-like protein modifier, implicating new enzymatic activities in insulin action.  In mice, this proteolytic pathway controls glucose metabolism and energy expenditure, and data imply that vesicle cargos other than GLUT4 may contribute to the regulation of vasopressin action and lipid metabolism.  Thus, regulated TUG cleavage and vesicle translocation may coordinate distinct physiologic outputs, and dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to multiple aspects of the metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathway that is utilized by GLUT4 is likely one instance of a general pathway to regulate the cell surface targeting of membrane proteins in response to extracellular stimuli.  Work on GLUT4 targeting may thus have far-reaching implications for a wide range of physiology.  In addition, this regulated pathway is likely a cell type-specific adaptation of a fundamental trafficking pathway present in most cells.  Current work will elucidate this pathway and how it is adapted to control GLUT4, using a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches, genetically engineered mice, and studies of organism-level metabolism and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much current work in the laboratory focuses</del><ins class='diffmod'>acts</ins> on a <del class='diffmod'>proteolytic</del><ins class='diffmod'>GLUT4-TUG</ins> <del class='diffmod'>mechanism</del><ins class='diffmod'>protein</ins> <del class='diffmod'>that</del><ins class='diffmod'>complex</ins> <del class='diffmod'>regulates</del><ins class='diffmod'>to cleave TUG and liberate GLUT4. A second area of research studies the control of</ins> glucose uptake in <del class='diffdel'>fat and </del>muscle<del class='diffdel'>.  Previous work identified the TUG protein as a critical regulator of GLUT4 targeting, which limits cell-surface GLUT4 and glucose uptake in cells not stimulated with insulin.  TUG traps GLUT4 in non-endosomal vesicles, bound at the Golgi matrix</del>, and <del class='diffmod'>insulin</del><ins class='diffmod'>examines</ins> <del class='diffmod'>triggers endoproteolytic cleavage</del><ins class='diffmod'>importance</ins> of <del class='diffdel'>TUG to liberate </del>these <del class='diffmod'>vesicles</del><ins class='diffmod'>pathways</ins> for <del class='diffmod'>translocation to the cell surface.  GLUT4 and other vesicle cargos are then maintained at the cell surface by cycling through endosomes, and they bypass a TUG-regulated compartment until insulin signaling is terminated, and the cargos are re-sequestered.  This arrangement obviates the need for ongoing TUG cleavage during sustained insulin exposure.  TUG cleavage generates a product that functions as a novel ubiquitin-like protein modifier, implicating new enzymatic activities in insulin action.  In mice, this proteolytic pathway controls</del><ins class='diffmod'>overall</ins> glucose <del class='diffmod'>metabolism</del><ins class='diffmod'>homeostasis</ins> and energy <del class='diffmod'>expenditure</del><ins class='diffmod'>metabolism. Finally</ins>, <del class='diffmod'>and</del><ins class='diffmod'>studies</ins> <del class='diffmod'>data</del><ins class='diffmod'>are</ins> <del class='diffmod'>imply</del><ins class='diffmod'>now</ins> <del class='diffmod'>that</del><ins class='diffmod'>underway</ins> <del class='diffmod'>vesicle</del><ins class='diffmod'>to</ins> <del class='diffmod'>cargos</del><ins class='diffmod'>determine</ins> <del class='diffmod'>other</del><ins class='diffmod'>how</ins> <del class='diffmod'>than</del><ins class='diffmod'>dysregulated</ins> GLUT4<ins class='diffins'> targeting</ins> may contribute to <del class='diffmod'>the</del><ins class='diffmod'>insulin</ins> <del class='diffmod'>regulation of vasopressin action and lipid metabolism.  Thus, regulated TUG cleavage and vesicle translocation may coordinate distinct physiologic outputs, and dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to multiple aspects of the metabolic syndrome</del><ins class='diffmod'>resistance</ins>.&lt;/p&gt;<del class='diffdel'>
&lt;p&gt;The pathway that is utilized by GLUT4 is likely one instance of a general pathway to regulate the cell surface targeting of membrane proteins in response to extracellular stimuli.  Work on GLUT4 targeting may thus have far-reaching implications for a wide range of physiology.  In addition, this regulated pathway is likely a cell type-specific adaptation of a fundamental trafficking pathway present in most cells.  Current work will elucidate this pathway and how it is adapted to control GLUT4, using a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches, genetically engineered mice, and studies of organism-level metabolism and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</del>

										<li>Dr. Boyer&#39;s laboratory has pioneered in establishing the molecular and cellular basis for bile secretory function of the liver. In the late 1970’s, he established that the sodium pump was localized to the basolateral membrane of the hepatocytes. This work placed the hepatocyte as a more typical polarized epithelium and allowed paradigms that were developed in other polarized epithelia to be applied to the liver. For example, this finding allowed Dr. Boyer’s lab to purify canalicular membranes away from the basolateral domain and thus introduce the use of membrane vesicle preparations for studying transport activity. The development of in-vivo models for studying bile secretory functions (the hepatocytes couplet and the isolated bile duct unit) initially from rats and later from mice was also a major technical advance for the field. These models have been widely used by many investigators for the study of hepatobiliary transport function in live cell preparations without the confounding effects of blood flow inherent in intact or isolated perfused rat livers. These models also permit the localization of specific functions to either hepatocytes or cholangiocytes. His laboratory was also the first to demonstrate and annunciate the concept that hepatobiliary transporters undergo adaptive regulation in response to cholestatic liver injury both in liver and in kidney. This is an area of investigation now widely pursued by many laboratories and continues to be a current focus. This work has led to current studies of the role of nuclear receptors in the regulation of transporter expression and a search for novel therapies directed to stimulation of this adaptive response. The impact of this body of work has been recognized by the Adolf Windaus Prize presented by the Falk Foundation in 1988, the Distinguished Achievement Award from the American Gastroenterology Association in 1989, the Distinguished Achievement Award from the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease in 1998 and the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award from the American Liver Association in 1999. The more recent discovery of a novel heteromeric organic solute transporter, Ostalph-Ost beta in the liver of the marine skate by Dr. Boyer and his colleague, Ned Ballatori has led serendipitoiusly to the finding that this is the missing link the basolateral ideal transporter)in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts. This important discovery came from work at the Mt Desert Island biological Laboratory in Maine where Dr. Boyer and colleagues have pursued seasonal research using a comparative animal model approach with marine vertebrates for nearly 4 decades. Most recently the finding that retinoids are a potent agonist for both marine elasmobranch and human nuclear receptor FXR has led to a clinical efficacy therapeutic trialing patients with sclerosing cholangitits.

										<li>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution of mammalian developmental enhancers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For over 30 years researchers have hypothesized that the small number of differences in protein-coding genes between closely related mammalian species (i.e. human vs chimp) are likely not sufficient to explain significant differences in physiology and morphology. Many have postulated that species differences in form and function likely arise not from differences in the functions of genes themselves but how their expression is regulated in both the adult and developing embryo&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. I addressed this hypothesis during my postdoctoral work in the Noonan lab through comparative epigenetic analysis of human, rhesus monkey and mouse limb development&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. I developed experimental techniques to perform global profiling of activation-associated post-translational modifications of histone proteins in extremely small amounts of embryonic tissue and computational pipelines to process and compare these genomic signals across multiple genomes. These techniques allowed the identification of thousands of sequences that are potentially regulating gene expression in a defined human tissue and developmental timeframe that are distinct from activities observed in the homologous developmental states of rhesus monkeys and mice. Along with other members of the Noonan lab, we then integrated these data with global limb transcriptome data and human population data to identify regulatory changes likely to have biological function in human limb development. The human gains of activation based on histone modification levels are significantly associated with increased expression of approximately 300 genes in human limb tissue compared to similar stages in mouse suggesting &lt;em&gt;bona fide&lt;/em&gt; regulatory change in embryonic limb development. This work also demonstrated the first &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experimental evidence of a gain of enhancer function in human embryonic development and provides an initial estimate for the rate of gene regulatory change in embryonic development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, it remains to be determined if this trend is the same across similar evolutionary time scales and multiple developmental tissues. I aim to employ these comparative functional genomics techniques in multiple rodent species that span evolutionary distances similar to those estimated between human and other apes or old world monkeys (up to 25 million years). I will comprehensively identify enhancers and genes active during developmental patterning of several structures (i.e. brain, lung, heart, and limb) in several rodent species using multiple functional marks. I will then compare the activation states, target gene expression levels, and sequence composition of these enhancers both within and across species. Using inbred rodent species for these types of experiments compared to the previous studies I have performed has several key advantages. First, examining closely related laboratory strains of C57BL6/J and A/J mice to other mouse species and the Norwegian Rat will allow interrogation of well defined evolutionary distances and reduce impacts of inter-individual genetic variability. Second, they have similar lengths of gestation and similar developmental morphology that allow unambiguous dissection of homologous tissues across species. Third, embryos can be generated at a scale that cannot be matched by timed rhesus pregnancies and collection of donated human embryonic material. Lastly, the function of a particular enhancer in multiple genetic backgrounds can be assessed during embryonic development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Related to this last concept I aim to identify the functional sequence changes in developmental enhancers that impart species-specific function on a global scale. I will utilize previously published high-throughput enhancer readout assays, STARR-Seq&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, in a genome-wide fashion to compare enhancer activity from several species. Briefly, the entire genome of a species is sheared to ~500 bp and inserted downstream of a minimal promoter and reporter gene. Instead of directing expression of only a reporter gene, the enhancer sequence is also transcribed producing a direct readout of enhancer activity in RNA form. This will allow enhancer activity comparisons in a common trans-environment that models a developmental state or tissue, such as limb derived mouse embryonic fibroblasts or neural crest cells differentiated from embryonic stem cells. Identifying the rate at which developmental enhancer sequence content changes and ultimately how their gene regulatory capacity is altered will deepen our understanding of the evolutionary forces controlling embryonic development, identify commonly targeted genetic architecture, and begin to unravel the complex information encoded within these regulatory sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancer sequence variation and human disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The vast majority of commonly occurring variants identified by genome-wide association studies for a variety of diseases are located in non-coding portions of the genome suggesting improper regulation of gene expression is a major contributor to human disease&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. I plan investigate this issue by developing a research program focused on identification of causal enhancer variation in developmental defects and begin to unravel how commonly occurring variants interact with a specific genetic background to produce a disease phenotype. Genes required for developmental patterning, such as homeobox transcription factors or signaling molecules like Sonic hedgehog (&lt;em&gt;SHH&lt;/em&gt;), have complex expression patterns in multiple embryonic tissues. Activation of such genes in a precise spatiotemporal fashion is facilitated by numerous enhancers found in the non-genic portions of the genome. Loss of function mutations in genes involved in patterning are typically lethal or cause gross abnormalities, while disruptions of the enhancers that control those genes are much less dramatic and isolated to specific tissues. The tissue-specific nature of the few known enhancer defects make non-syndromic birth defects an area ripe for investigation of the general role of enhancer dysfunction and human disease. I aim to initially leverage commonly occurring non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (NSCLP) defects to identify causal enhancer variation and dissect the mechanisms that are affected in these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Human orofacial clefts can be diagnosed at approximately 16 weeks of gestation&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, however they occur as early as 5 weeks&lt;sup&gt;6,7&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, to identify processes that are disrupted by variants in regulatory sequences, tissue from these early stages must be interrogated when important regulatory pathways are active. Using experimental and computational methods I have developed to globally profile active promoters and enhancers in small amounts of embryonic tissue&lt;sup&gt;2,8&lt;/sup&gt;, I will globally characterize craniofacial gene regulation directly in human embryonic tissue at the developmental stages when fusion of orofacial structures is determined. I will integrate active enhancer and promoter maps with NSCLP associated SNPs to identify regulatory elements that potentially influence the formation of NSCLP. I will screen enhancers in strong linkage disequilibrium with NSCLP variants in a patient cohort to identify candidate causative variation using molecular inversion probe technology&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. I then aim to functionally characterize the regulatory capacity of the identified enhancers and NSCLP associated alleles in mouse craniofacial embryonic development. These experiments will identify the stages of development that these enhancers exert regulatory control, will begin to reveal the genetic architecture of NSCLP, and provide targets for future genetic screening. This line of experimental work will establish a paradigm for understanding virtually any developmental disorder that is caused, at least in part, by improper gene regulation during embryonic patterning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-distance regulation of gene expression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To fully understand how developmental enhancers influence phenotype and cause disease their regulatory targets must be identified. Enhancers can be found in close proximity to their regulatory targets or potentially operate over entire chromosomes. Recent studies indicate chromosomes maintain static topological domains that are several megabases in size that limit the scope of enhancer influence and establish microcosms of co-regulated genes&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. Within these large topological domains, enhancers have been shown to interact with target promoters through poorly understood looping mechanisms&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;. The majority of loops that have been detected thus far are stable across tissues, developmental contexts, and species&lt;sup&gt;12-14&lt;/sup&gt;. This could indicate the looping events are static and are not the drivers of gene activation as many models have suggested. Alternatively current methods are only capable of detecting the most stable or frequent events and many enhancer-promoter interactions are dynamic and only occur in specific contexts. Histone modification data and the specificity of many experimentally tested developmental enhancers would suggest that the latter is a more likely scenario but this remains to be determined. I aim to identify the targets of developmental enhancers and determine the mechanism by which tissue-specific developmental enhancers identify and interact with these targets. This will require refinement of current chromosome conformation capture experiments and application to developmental contexts, such as defined stages of mammalian limb development, where many tissue specific enhancers and likely targets have been previously identified. I will leverage my experience from the design and implementation of the first ChIA-PET experiment in embryonic tissue&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; to refine methods for identifying promoter-enhancer and enhancer-enhancer interactions that regulate gene expression in a tissue-specific fashion. I have identified a number of limb-specific regulatory domains in the mouse that can be interrogated to identify dynamics of interactions and the proteins that are found in these tissue-specific complexes&lt;sup&gt;2,8&lt;/sup&gt;. Identifying how enhancers and promoters interact in a tissue-specific fashion and the proteins facilitating these interactions will increase our understanding of precisely controlled spatiotemporal gene expression during embryonic development. This will provide a basis to dissect developmental disorders that are likely to arise from improperly controlled gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>The Breaker laboratory uses a variety of approaches to explore the
fundamental properties of nucleic acids. For example, the laboratory
develops new techniques for in vitro selection to create new functional
RNAs and DNAs. In vitro selection is patterned after natural Darwinian
evolution, but where &quot;survival-of-the-fittest&quot; is played out at the
molecular level in the absence of living cells. Up to 100 trillion
different molecules can be subjected to this test-tube evolution
process to isolate or engineer molecules that perform tasks such as
catalysis and molecular sensing.
&lt;p&gt;Previous molecular engineering projects have provided evidence that
both RNA and DNA have substantial untapped potential for sophisticated
biochemical function. For example, we have produced a variety of new
DNA enzymes, some that operate under cell-like conditions and perform
reactions that mimic important biochemical transformations. In
addition, we have generated dozens of examples of RNAs that function as
designer molecular switches that respond to specific small molecules.
These findings demonstrate that the primary roles of RNA and DNA in
nature might be greater than currently appreciated, and suggests that
the function of nucleic acids could be expanded via molecular
engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
Inspired by these molecular engineering demonstrations, we have more
recently begun to search for novel types of non-coding RNAs that
perform undiscovered catalytic or molecular sensing tasks in cells. We
have identified numerous classes of &quot;riboswitches&quot;, which are
metabolite-binding mRNA domains that control genes responsible for
biosynthesis of essential compounds. Among the first dozen riboswitches
classes identified are representatives that sense coenzymes,
nucleobases, amino acids or sugars. Some riboswitch classes exhibit
complex biochemical behaviors including ribozyme activity, cooperative
ligand binding, and logic gate function. In addition, we have
identified other non-coding RNAs that are not riboswitches, but whose
biological functions remain to be established. We will continue to use
bioinformatics, genetics, and biochemistry techniques to discover new
types of non-coding RNAs and to establish the functions of these

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My primary research interest is the elucidation of neurobiological mechanisms underlying the interface between stress, mindfulness and the addictive process, and in developing effective means for the modulation of these processes to better treat substance use disorders. In such, the principal focus of my laboratory is on studying mindfulness training as a mechanistic probe and treatment for addictions. Using neurobiological and physiological probes such as real-time fMRI, skin conductance, and heart rate variability, we measure the effects that mindfulness training has on stress provocation and treatment outcomes in individuals with addictive disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, my laboratory is interested in improving methods to assay mindfulness practice and acquisition. We are working to delineate brain activation patterns during specific meditation techniques, and to link these to physiological and behavioral measures. Ultimately, we hope to be able to use this knowledge to not only more accurately measure neurophysiological correlates of mindfulness, but to improve mindfulness acquisition using techniques such as neurofeedback, leading to directly measurable effects on health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>The ocular ciliary epithelium as a novel endocrine secretory epithelium: The secretion of aqueous humor and the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP) are physiologically and pathophysiologically important processes for the integrity and normal function of the mammalian eye. Aqueous humor provides nutrients and oxygen to the avascular anterior segment of he eye, and sustains inflation of the globe, ensuring normal visual function. The ciliary epithelium, a bilayer of secretory neuroepithelial cells, is the site of synthesis of aqueous humor (inflow system), and regulates its secretion by the coordinated action of a complex transport system involving ion channels and active ion secretion, from the stromal to the aqueous-humor surface, followed by osmotic water movement. The aqueous humor fluid leaves the eye through the trabecular meshwork and the Schlemm channel (outflow system). A balance between the rates of secretion and drainage of the aqueous humor determines the level of IOP. Clarifying the mechanisms and regulation of aqueous humor formation can lead to novel strategies for lowering IOP, the only intervention known to retard the onset and progression of blindness in glaucoma. In glaucoma, elevated IOP is one of the strongest known risk factors. IOP elevation in human glaucoma results from an obstruction of the outflow system leading to an abnormal increase in eye pressure, death of retinal ganglion cells and loss of vision. The most effective way to lower IOP is by targeting the inflow system with drugs that reduce the rate of secretion of aqueous humor. Thus, an understanding of the biology of the ciliary epithelium, at the cellular and molecular levels, is essential in our knowledge of how IOP is regulated in normal conditions and in glaucoma. Our laboratory has identified a large number of genes relevant to the cell and molecular functions of the human ciliary epithelium. The information of over 300 independent subtracted ESTs (we called CBS clones for Ciliary Body Subtracted) is now deposited and registered in the National Eye Institute Bank (NEIBank), a repository database of the genes expressed in distinct tissues of the human eye on the project website http://neibank.nei.nih.gov). We have proposed that the neuroendocrine peptides and hormones processed by the ciliary epithelium, serve to establish cross-talk communication, according to classical endocrine, paracrine and autocrine modes of action, with target tissues including the vascular endothelium, the ciliary muscle and the cells in the outflow pathway, to regulate IOP. &lt;br&gt;Current work in our laboratory focuses on the hypotensive function of natriuretic peptides in the eye. We found that natriuretic peptides acting on natriuretic peptide receptors type B in the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, blocked the activity of the Na+/H+-exchanger, a cellular sensor of cell volume and intracellular pH. The predicted net result of the Na+/H+-exchanger inhibition is the reduction of aqueous humor secretion and IOP. This interpretation is consistent with two sets of independent studies indicating that: 1) inhibitors of the Na+/H+-exchanger; and 2) natriuretic peptides, elicit ocular hypotensive effect by lowering IOP in experimental animals. We do not preclude that this mechanism might be similar in the outflow system where NP receptors are also present (Figure?.) These studies open a great opportunity to consider inhibitors of the Na+/H+-exchanger in the inflow and outflow systems as a key gene target to lower IOP in glaucoma. &lt;br&gt;Additional studies are under way to elucidate the intracellular signaling pathway of the natriuretic peptide receptors and other neuropeptide receptors including somatostatin receptors that lead to the attenuation of the Na+/H+-exchanger. Glaucoma genes: structure-function relationship Seven chromosomal loci (GLC1A-GLC1G) have so far been implicated in Primary Open Angle Glaucoma, of which three genes, Myocilin (MYOC) on GLC1A (1q23), Optineurin (OPTN) on GLC1E (10qp14) and WDR36 on GLC1G (5q22.1) have been identified. &lt;br&gt;At present our work focus on myocilin a 55-57kDa glycoprotein of unknown function, originally identified in cultured trabecular meshwork cells upon induction with glucocorticoids. MYOC was independently cloned from the human ciliary body and the retina. MYOC is mutated in certain forms of glaucoma, including Juvenile open angle glaucoma and Primary-open angle glaucoma. &lt;br&gt;The gene consists of three exons. Exon I, encodes the amino-terminal region of myocilin and contains a cleavable signal peptide at position 32, and a leucine-zipper like domain with leucine and arginine repeats along in an alpha-helix conformation. Exon II, encodes the central region of the protein a linker between the N- and C-terminal regions. Finally, exon III is homologous to olfactomedin, an extracellular matrix protein rich in the olfactory neuroepithelium. The leucine-zipper-like domain of myocilin shares low homology (20-28%) with the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family of proteins, contractile proteins (smooth muscle myosin), and transcription factors lacking the basic DNA binding region. The ERM proteins crosslink actin filaments with plasma membrane. So far, the majority of the mutations identified in MYOC, in glaucoma patients, have been found along the olfactomedin-like domain (Figure ). Recent studies, in collaboration with Dr. Julio Escribano (Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Albacete, Spain), have revealed that myocilin undergoes an intracellular endoproteolytic cleavage between amino acids Arg226 and Ile227 . This processing predicts the production of two fragments which are co-secreted with the nonprocessed myocilin protein. We proposed that inhibition of the normal processing by myocilin when is mutated may explain in part the pathogenesis of glaucoma. &lt;br&gt;Our work on MYOC focuses on the structural motifs present in myocilin, and on their involvement on multiple molecular interactions with other proteins. Furthermore, we are interested in determining how specific mutations in myocilin leading to glaucoma can affect the interaction with other interacting proteins. Recent studies have shown that myocilin interacts in vitro with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including fibronectin and type I collagen. Ongoing work in our laboratory, at Yale, is searching for proteins that interact with myocilin using the GAL-4 based yeast two-hybrid system. We have identified and initially characterized one gene encoding the half-carboxyl terminus of the protein hevin, a secretory glycoprotein and a member of the SPARC/BM-40/ Osteonectin family of extracellular proteins as an interacting protein with myocilin. Interestingly we have found that a specific mutation in myocilin (P370L) inhibits the normal secretion of the half-carboxyl terminus of the protein hevin, suggesting that myocilin establish a regulatory effect on the normal function of other key proteins (Li et al. 2006).&lt;br&gt;Further studies are underway to determine the exact inhibitory mechanism exerted by distinct myocilin mutations causing glaucoma. These studies open a great opportunity to explore in what extent mutations causing glaucoma alter the normal function of the cell where is expressed. We are interested in finding this in two specific eye-cell types: in the ciliary epithelium, and in the trabecular meshwork. Both cell types are involved in the regulation of IOP. These studies ultimately will lead us to learn the function of myocilin in glaucoma, and therefore to design strategies to revert the abnormal function of the protein when mutated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

										<li>										The ocular ciliary epithelium as a novel endocrine secretory epithelium: The secretion of aqueous humor and the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP) are physiologically and pathophysiologically important processes for the integrity and normal function of the mammalian eye. Aqueous humor provides nutrients and oxygen to the avascular anterior segment of he eye, and sustains inflation of the globe, ensuring normal visual function. The ciliary epithelium, a bilayer of secretory neuroepithelial cells, is the site of synthesis of aqueous humor (inflow system), and regulates its secretion by the coordinated action of a complex transport system involving ion channels and active ion secretion, from the stromal to the aqueous-humor surface, followed by osmotic water movement. The aqueous humor fluid leaves the eye through the trabecular meshwork and the Schlemm channel (outflow system). A balance between the rates of secretion and drainage of the aqueous humor determines the level of IOP. Clarifying the mechanisms and regulation of aqueous humor formation can lead to novel strategies for lowering IOP, the only intervention known to retard the onset and progression of blindness in glaucoma. In glaucoma, elevated IOP is one of the strongest known risk factors. IOP elevation in human glaucoma results from an obstruction of the outflow system leading to an abnormal increase in eye pressure, death of retinal ganglion cells and loss of vision. The most effective way to lower IOP is by targeting the inflow system with drugs that reduce the rate of secretion of aqueous humor. Thus, an understanding of the biology of the ciliary epithelium, at the cellular and molecular levels, is essential in our knowledge of how IOP is regulated in normal conditions and in glaucoma. Our laboratory has identified a large number of genes relevant to the cell and molecular functions of the human ciliary epithelium. The information of over 300 independent subtracted ESTs (we called CBS clones for Ciliary Body Subtracted) is now deposited and registered in the National Eye Institute Bank (NEIBank), a repository database of the genes expressed in distinct tissues of the human eye on the project website http://neibank.nei.nih.gov). We have proposed that the neuroendocrine peptides and hormones processed by the ciliary epithelium, serve to establish cross-talk communication, according to classical endocrine, paracrine and autocrine modes of action, with target tissues including the vascular endothelium, the ciliary muscle and the cells in the outflow pathway, to regulate IOP. &lt;br&gt;Current work in our laboratory focuses on the hypotensive function of natriuretic peptides in the eye. We found that natriuretic peptides acting on natriuretic peptide receptors type B in the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, blocked the activity of the Na+/H+-exchanger, a cellular sensor of cell volume and intracellular pH. The predicted net result of the Na+/H+-exchanger inhibition is the reduction of aqueous humor secretion and IOP. This interpretation is consistent with two sets of independent studies indicating that: 1) inhibitors of the Na+/H+-exchanger; and 2) natriuretic peptides, elicit ocular hypotensive effect by lowering IOP in experimental animals. We do not preclude that this mechanism might be similar in the outflow system where NP receptors are also present (Figure?.) These studies open a great opportunity to consider inhibitors of the Na+/H+-exchanger in the inflow and outflow systems as a key gene target to lower IOP in glaucoma. &lt;br&gt;Additional studies are under way to elucidate the intracellular signaling pathway of the natriuretic peptide receptors and other neuropeptide receptors including somatostatin receptors that lead to the attenuation of the Na+/H+-exchanger. Glaucoma genes: structure-function relationship Seven chromosomal loci (GLC1A-GLC1G) have so far been implicated in Primary Open Angle Glaucoma, of which three genes, Myocilin (MYOC) on GLC1A (1q23), Optineurin (OPTN) on GLC1E (10qp14) and WDR36 on GLC1G (5q22.1) have been identified. &lt;br&gt;At present our work focus on myocilin a 55-57kDa glycoprotein of unknown function, originally identified in cultured trabecular meshwork cells upon induction with glucocorticoids. MYOC was independently cloned from the human ciliary body and the retina. MYOC is mutated in certain forms of glaucoma, including Juvenile open angle glaucoma and Primary-open angle glaucoma. &lt;br&gt;The gene consists of three exons. Exon I, encodes the amino-terminal region of myocilin and contains a cleavable signal peptide at position 32, and a leucine-zipper like domain with leucine and arginine repeats along in an alpha-helix conformation. Exon II, encodes the central region of the protein a linker between the N- and C-terminal regions. Finally, exon III is homologous to olfactomedin, an extracellular matrix protein rich in the olfactory neuroepithelium. The leucine-zipper-like domain of myocilin shares low homology (20-28%) with the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family of proteins, contractile proteins (smooth muscle myosin), and transcription factors lacking the basic DNA binding region. The ERM proteins crosslink actin filaments with plasma membrane. So far, the majority of the mutations identified in MYOC, in glaucoma patients, have been found along the olfactomedin-like domain (Figure ). Recent studies, in collaboration with Dr. Julio Escribano (Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Albacete, Spain), have revealed that myocilin undergoes an intracellular endoproteolytic cleavage between amino acids Arg226 and Ile227 . This processing predicts the production of two fragments which are co-secreted with the nonprocessed myocilin protein. We proposed that inhibition of the normal processing by myocilin when is mutated may explain in part the pathogenesis of glaucoma. &lt;br&gt;Our work on MYOC focuses on the structural motifs present in myocilin, and on their involvement on multiple molecular interactions with other proteins. Furthermore, we are interested in determining how specific mutations in myocilin leading to glaucoma can affect the interaction with other interacting proteins. Recent studies have shown that myocilin interacts in vitro with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including fibronectin and type I collagen. Ongoing work in our laboratory, at Yale, is searching for proteins that interact with myocilin using the GAL-4 based yeast two-hybrid system. We have identified and initially characterized one gene encoding the half-carboxyl terminus of the protein hevin, a secretory glycoprotein and a member of the SPARC/BM-40/ Osteonectin family of extracellular proteins as an interacting protein with myocilin.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;The DiMaio lab has developed novel protein engineering and directed evolution strategies to study transmembrane protein interactions. We use randomized and mutagenized libraries expressing small transmembrane proteins to modulate the activities of various cellular and viral transmembrane proteins. Since transmembrane proteins make up over 30% of all cellular proteins, they are an important class of proteins to investigate, but can be challenging to study due to their localization in hydrophobic membranes. Currently, I am determining the mechanism by which a small artificial transmembrane protein activates the human erythropoietin receptor (hEPOR) in the absence of its natural ligand, erythropoietin (EPO). The hEPOR is a cytokine receptor that is required for red blood cell production. Upon retroviral expression of the small transmembrane protein activator in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that express the hEPOR endogenously, it can induce erythroid differentiation in the absence of EPO as measured by several markers of differentiation. I use various genetic, biochemical, and molecular biology methods to gain further insights as to how the activator functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this work, we&#39;ve shown how these novel proteins engage in highly specific protein-protein interactions and they may provide insights into receptor signaling and cell biology. These proteins have the potential to function as biological tools to probe protein-protein interactions within the membrane.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>An example of my research in basic radiation dosimetry involved the determination of dose rate constant (DRC) for radioactive sources used in interstitial brachytherapy. The DRC is a fundamental quantity that links the intrinsic dosimetry properties of a radioactive source to the proper fulfillment of prescription dose in patient dosimetry. An accurate determination of DRC has been regarded as one of the most important tasks in characterizing the basic properties of radioactive sources. However, accurate determination of DRC for the sources emitting photons of less than 50 keV has remained a challenge in radiation dosimetry because of the lack of a suitable absolute dosimeter for accurate measurement of doses near the source. Existing experimental techniques have large overall uncertainties on the order of 8-10% at one standard deviation and 15% at the 95% confidence level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have developed a general formalism for DRC that permitted detailed elucidation of the general properties underlying the determination of DRC. Based on this theoretical finding, we have subsequently developed a new photon spectrometry technique for accurate determination of the DRC of low-energy interstitial brachytherapy sources. This new technique eliminated many of the difficulties associated with the existing experimental techniques and has provided new and independent determinations of DRC for over twenty low-energy brachytherapy source models. Its application has led to the discovery of a 15% discrepancy in the DRC reported for a newly marketed cesium-131 source and has helped resolve a large discrepancy in the DRCs reported in literature for a novel polymer-encapsulated palladium-103 source. The photon spectrometry technique is efficient and robust. We are developing it into a national resource for DRC determination and for periodic quality assurance check of DRC.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example of my research work in treatment plan optimization and evaluation involved the derivation of a new radiobiological formalism for biologically effective dose (BED) of permanent interstitial brachytherapy (PIB) using sources of different decay half-lives. In PIB, the cancer cells are subjected to continuous photon irradiation. Because tumor cell repopulation and sub-lethal damage repair occur simultaneously during dose delivery, the net cell kill and therefore the clinical efficacy of PIB depend not only on the delivered dose but also on the interplay between the temporal patterns of dose delivery and cellular kinetics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BED formula captures this interplay and has enabled systematic evaluation of the potential clinical impacts of using mixed sources on cancers presenting different biological properties. This formalism has also enabled us to systematically examine the radiobiological effects of prostate edema in PIB for early stage prostate cancer and many of the theoretical issues related to the design of an effective dose compensation approach for edema-induced dose deficits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This latter application has provided some of the preliminary data for a R01 research project currently funded by NIH since September 2008 (R01CA134627-01 Prostate Edema in Permanent Interstitial Brachytherapy, PI: Zhe Chen, Ph.D). The R01 project aims to quantitatively characterize the dosimetric and radiobiologic effects of prostate edema and to develop effective therapeutic interventions so that the efficacy of PIB can be optimized for each individual prostate cancer patient.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other examples of my research work have dealt with clinical dosimetry and quality assurance for radiation therapy techniques ranging from intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), total-skin electron therapy (TSET) for cultaneous T-cell lymphoma, total-body irradiation (TBI) for bone marrow transplant and image guidance in the planning, delivery and evaluation of radiation therapy.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Our general goal is to characterize the mechanisms regulating sodium, acid-base, and anion excretion by the kidney.

One approach involves the generation of isoform- and phospho-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to identify the cellular and subcellular sites of expression of ion exchangers in the kidney and other tissues, and to study their regulation. A complementary approach uses mice with targeted gene disruption to elucidate the physiological roles of ion exchangers and associated proteins under &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; conditions. For example, work with mice lacking anion exchanger Slc26a6, which can function as an oxalate transporter, revealed a phenotype of calcium oxalate kidney stones.

										<li>My research investigates the most prevalent and yet commonly overlooked type of psychiatric comorbidity – substance abuse and personality disorders.  I have conducted a systematic series of studies that have: evaluated the personality dimensions common to both of these psychiatric disorders; identified personality-related subtypes of substance abuse with greater symptom severity and worse prognosis, and; developed and tested the first psychotherapeutic model for the full range of personality disorders found in substance abusers.  Personality traits appear to be risk factors for substance use, as well as risk factors for personality disorders that have substance abuse as an important behavioral expression.  Maladaptive personality traits and related personality disorders are not simply consequences of addiction. Previous, ongoing, and planned studies focus on two major areas related to personality and substance use disorders: 1) assessment and diagnosis; 2) psychotherapy efficacy.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)  Assessment and Diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over half of treated substance abusers meet diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder.  The separation of addiction symptoms from personality traits and disorders through careful assessment is critically important for improving diagnostic reliability and validity and predicting treatment response.  Personality disorders influence symptom severity, persist and interfere with psychosocial functioning once abstinence is achieved, create significant ongoing risk for relapse, and may require additional specialized treatment.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 20 years, my research has focused on evaluating extreme, maladaptive personality traits and the prevalence and treatment implications of personality disorders in substance abusers.  I have mapped personality dimensions from five factor and seven factor models onto personality disorder diagnoses and compared the reliability of personality disorder and trait dimensions.  A constellation of maladaptive personality traits is related to substance dependence severity, polydrug use, earlier age of onset, chronic/heavy use, conduct and antisocial personality disorders, violence, arrests, HIV risk behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, mood disorders, suicide attempts, and early treatment drop-out.  My work has emphasized the importance of utilizing dimensional models of personality disorders which incorporate symptom severity measures of diagnostic interview categories as well as self-report measures of maladaptive personality traits and problems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consistent with the increased appreciation of the heterogeneity of addicted persons, my research has emphasized that personality factors can be viewed as etiologically or prognostically linked to some, but not necessarily all, subtypes of substance abusers.  I have evaluated an empirical framework for understanding the relation between personality dimensions, substance abuse, and personality disorders through a typological system which organizes diverse variables into broader constructs which are associated with different etiologies, patterns, and courses of the disorder.  This work included the first extension of a multidimensional alcoholism typology to the drug abuse field. One type (variously called Type I or Type A) is characterized by later age of onset, lower heritability, fewer childhood risk factors, and less severe dependence.  The second type (Type II or B) is characterized by earlier onset, higher heritability, more childhood risk factors, more severe dependence, greater psychosocial impairment, antisocial behavior, and psychiatric comorbidity.  In a series of studies, I validated this Type A/B and established its connection to certain personality traits and disorders.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although antisocial and borderline are the most common personality disorders in addiction treatment settings, other disorders (avoidant, paranoid, dependent, narcissistic) affect a significant minority of substance abuse patients, but have not been the focus of diagnostic or treatment research. Other personality disorders, referred to as Cluster A or psychotic spectrum (schizoid, schizotypal, paranoid), are the most common form of diagnostic comorbidity in a group of substance abusers who have had limited or ineffective interactions with the addiction and mental health treatment system (i.e., homeless persons). The development of an effective therapy for the diverse groups of treatment refractory, personality disordered substance abusers has been the focus of my second major area of research and contribution to the field.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)  Psychotherapy Efficacy &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Although personality disorders are the most common form of psychiatric comorbidity in drug abusers and convey a negative prognosis, treatments have been adapted or tested for only two specific diagnoses (antisocial and borderline personality disorders). I am the originator of Dual Focus Schema Therapy (DFST) which is the only psychotherapy manual developed and tested for the full range of personality disorders encountered in substance abusers. The problem targets for this treatment are early maladaptive schemas and the associated coping styles related to addictive behaviors. The development of a personality disorder is conceptualized as an interaction between biologically-based personality or temperament traits and highly dysfunctional early caretaking environments which contribute to the development of enduring, unconditional, negative beliefs about oneself, others, and the world and coping behaviors that are inappropriate, rigid, and difficult to change.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DFST is an integrative, cognitive-behavioral therapy that targets these maladaptive personality processes (cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, emotional) that heighten risk for relapse and adversely impacts treatment engagement, retention, and outcome and the social supports necessary for long-term recovery. It is a manual-guided individual therapy based on a detailed, multi-level assessment and conceptualization of personality traits, problems, and disorders. Cognitive, behavioral, relational, and experiential techniques are selected that focus on reducing addiction and psychiatric symptoms, the intensity of affective and behavioral reactions to schema activation, and maladaptive methods of coping with high risk situations. The choice and staging of interventions is guided by a detailed case formulation of personality functioning and an open, ongoing, collaborative dialogue between the therapist and patient about personality problems, addictive behaviors, and the identification of specific target problems for intervention. This therapeutic partnership fosters the type of strong working alliance that psychotherapy research has found associated with positive outcomes and seems especially important with challenging, refractory patients. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have completed two smaller and one larger randomized clinical trials comparing DFST to standard addiction counseling approaches. All treatment studies involve very complex, traumatized, multi-problem patients. I have established the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of DFST and developed a: detailed session-by-session treatment manual with prescribed and proscribed techniques; comprehensive, effective training and supervisory procedure for therapists, and; adherence/competence rating system to measure treatment discriminability and fidelity. In the first study in outpatient methadone maintained personality disordered patients, DFST was superior to 12 Step Facilitation Therapy on the primary substance use outcome and secondary therapeutic alliance measure. In the second study in homeless substance abusers with personality disorders, DFST promoted better therapy utilization than a Drug Counseling group. However, homeless clients with more severe forms of certain personality disorders exhibited better Drug Counseling group utilization. The third study of patients in long-term residential treatment found that DFST promoted significant psychiatric, interpersonal, and negative affect symptom reduction over the duration of therapy. However, patients with certain personality disorders had better psychiatric symptom reduction in Individual Drug Counseling than DFST. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The randomized clinical trial of DFST conducted in a homeless drop-in center unexpectedly found rates of Cluster A (paranoid, schizotypal, schizoid) and Cluster C (especially obsessive-compulsive) personality disorders that were 5 – 15 times (i.e., 40 – 75% prevalence rates) more common than typically found in mental health and addiction treatment programs.  This was a new finding for the field as previous diagnostic research on the homeless had focused extensively on severe Axis I diagnoses (schizophrenic, mood, and substance use disorders) and ignored the Axis II diagnoses other than antisocial personality disorder.  My team completed three additional diagnostic studies, all of which confirm the very high prevalence of these psychotic-spectrum personality disorders among the homeless.  This has been the first research to conduct structured diagnostic interviews of the full range of personality disorders among homeless persons while controlling for the effects of other psychiatric disorders.  This diagnostic work has established the independence of these very common severe personality disorders from their related, but less prevalent, mood, schizophrenic, anxiety, and substance use disorders.  These severely traumatized, psychosocially challenged individuals have been insufficiently served by traditional treatment systems.  Other recent research evaluates the relation between maladaptive personality dimensions and addiction symptom severity, psychosocial functioning, relapse risk, treatment motivation and response through a longitudinal evaluation of predictors of outpatient treatment engagement and attrition.

										<li>In
addition to chemical imbalances, it is now clear that there are significant
structural alterations of limbic brain regions associated with depression, and
postmortem studies of MDD patients demonstrate morphological changes including
decreases in neuronal size and glial loss that could underlie these changes.

Most striking
are the consistent reports of decreased number and function of glia in limbic
regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex, suggesting a role for glia in the
neurobiology of MDD. These
studies have focused primarily on astrocytes, although changes in
oligodendrocytes have also been reported. The critical role of astrocytes in
providing metabolic and trophic support raise the possibility that the glial
loss could contribute to decreased size and function of neurons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it is
not clear if glial reductions are causally related to MDD, playing a direct
role in the expression of depressive symptoms, or are a consequence of the
illness. A related question is whether preventing glial deficits would
alleviate the symptoms of depression.

Although
these issues are difficult to address in MDD patients, progress is being made
in basic research studies. Exposing rats to chronic stress results in glial
reductions, as well as neuronal
atrophy similar to the changes observed in MDD patients. Chronic stress also reduces the
expression of specific astrocyte markers, as well as astrocytic metabolism in
the prefrontal cortex. 

In
rodents, chronic stress also results in behavioral alterations in tests
measuring anhedonia and helplessness, core symptoms of depression. Employing
these tests, the influence of compounds that disrupt astrocytic function or
that cause astrocytic death, on depressive-like behaviors has been determined.
Infusions of a toxin that causes glial death into the prefrontal cortex induced
anhedonia and helplessness and increases the susceptibility to stress. These findings provide the first evidence that loss of glia may
contribute to depressive symptoms and is not merely a side effect. Studies
using pharmacologic and genetic approaches aiming to identify the subtype(s) of
glial cells mediating these effects and the molecular determinants involved in
glial loss are currently underway.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, there has been considerable
enthusiasm for studying the antidepressant actions of agents that enhance glial
glutamate
uptake,
a key function of astrocytes. One such drug is
riluzole, known to delay the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a
neurodegenerative disease with documented astrocytic dysfunction. Riluzole is
reported to have antidepressant actions in MDD patients and in rodents, and
prevents the decrease in glial metabolism and loss induced by chronic stress.
Although additional studies with agents that selectively increase or protect
glial function are required to further test this hypothesis, this preliminary
research offers hope for an entirely new area, targeting glial function for the

addition to chemical imbalances, it is now clear that there are significant
structural alterations of limbic brain regions associated with depression, and
postmortem studies of MDD patients demonstrate morphological changes including
decreases in neuronal size and glial loss that could underlie these changes.

Most striking
are the consistent reports of decreased number and function of glia in limbic
regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex, suggesting a role for glia in the
neurobiology of MDD. These
studies have focused primarily on astrocytes, although changes in
oligodendrocytes have also been reported. The critical role of astrocytes in
providing metabolic and trophic support raise the possibility that the glial
loss could contribute to decreased size and function of neurons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it is
not clear if glial reductions are causally related to MDD, playing a direct
role in the expression of depressive symptoms, or are a consequence of the
illness. A related question is whether preventing glial deficits would
alleviate the symptoms of depression.

Although
these issues are difficult to address in MDD patients, progress is being made
in basic research studies. Exposing rats to chronic stress results in glial
reductions, as well as neuronal
atrophy similar to the changes observed in MDD patients. Chronic stress also reduces the
expression of specific astrocyte markers, as well as astrocytic metabolism in
the prefrontal cortex. 

In
rodents, chronic stress also results in behavioral alterations in tests
measuring anhedonia and helplessness, core symptoms of depression. Employing
these tests, the influence of compounds that disrupt astrocytic function or
that cause astrocytic death, on depressive-like behaviors has been determined.
Infusions of a toxin that causes glial death into the prefrontal cortex induced
anhedonia and helplessness and increases the susceptibility to stress. These findings provide the first evidence that loss of glia may
contribute to depressive symptoms and is not merely a side effect. Studies
using pharmacologic and genetic approaches aiming to identify the subtype(s) of
glial cells mediating these effects and the molecular determinants involved in
glial loss are currently underway.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, there has been considerable
enthusiasm for studying the antidepressant actions of agents that enhance glial
glutamate
uptake,
a key function of astrocytes. One such drug is
riluzole, known to delay the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a
neurodegenerative disease with documented astrocytic dysfunction. Riluzole is
reported to have antidepressant actions in MDD patients and in rodents, and
prevents the decrease in glial metabolism and loss induced by chronic stress.
Although additional studies with agents that selectively increase or protect
glial function are required to further test this hypothesis, this preliminary
research offers hope for an entirely new area, targeting glial function for the
treatment of depression.<ins class='diffins'>&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Action of stress and antidepressants on adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action of stress and antidepressants on gliogenesis in the prefrontal cortex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action of stress and antidepressants on mature glial cells &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implication of glial cells in the depression and stress related behaviors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glial function as a new target for antidepressant action&lt;/li&gt;

cells cells via exosomes [suppressor cell secreted nanovesicles (50-100nm) that
contain proteins, RNA and miRNA] to suppress immune responses. The effect produced
is systematic and thus endocrine in nature. Further, similar suppressive
exosomes can be found in the blood serum of mice tolerized to induce the
suppressive T cells that release supernatant of TsF RNA in exosomes, and
clinically in the blood of patients with cancer, autoimunity, allergy etc.   This cell to cell transfer, in a mammalian

this newly recognized mode of antigen-specific T cell suppression can be used
therapeutically, or inhibited with antagomirs where indicated.  Antagomirs could act to reverse suppressive miRNA in cancer.  This also could create a new pathway in
specific immunotherapy that could compliment existing non-specific treatments,
resulting in less toxic side effects, greater specificity, and safer use
of  higher doses of current non-specific
drugs (steroids) and biologics (anti-TNF etc). Alternatively, in vitro

We believe that the suppression of SPLUNC1 is a protective mechanism to limit neutrophilic inflammation and subsequent airway injury and so, high SPLUNC1 in CF may be detrimental by promoting neutrophilic inflammation, a fundamental part of CF lung disease pathogenesis. The objective of our research program is to understand how SPLUNC1 influences neutrophilic airway inflammation and if the modulation of SPLUNC1 can limit airway inflammation in CF.&lt;/p&gt;

The objective of our research program is to understand how SPLUNC1 influences neutrophilic airway inflammation and if the modulation of SPLUNC1 can limit airway inflammation in CF.&lt;/p&gt;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regulation of SPLUNC1 expression by the airway epithelium:&lt;/em&gt; identification of mechanisms by which pathogens, PAMPs and cytokines modulate SPLUNC1 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mechanisms of neutrophilic inflammation control by SPLUNC1: &lt;/em&gt;characterization of the role of SPLUNC1 in neutrophil recruitment to the lungs during acute airway inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Role of SPLUNC1 in immune responses in CF&lt;/em&gt;: defining mechanisms by which SPLUNC1 is increased in CF and what effect this increase has in neutrophilic immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;</ins>

We plan to determine the precise role of Hhex in these critical developmental processes and the factors with which it interacts using mouse molecular genetics, conditional gene knockouts, and transgenic overexpression in specific cells and tissues. The two major areas of focus in the lab are the roles that Hhex plays in liver and cardiovascular development. By studying the specific role of Hhex during development, we will gain important insight into the basic developmental mechanisms involved in early organogenesis of a number of different organs.

<ins class='diffins'>One of the most fundamental elements of brain function is a reciprocal interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurons.  A major focus in the lab is to understand how these populations of neurons regulate each other and contribute to information processing.  To explore this issue, we use intracellular and extracellular recordings, along with molecular genetics techniques.  Using cell type-specific expression of optogenetic tools, such as light-activated channels (Channelrhodopsin and Halorhodopsin), we can control the firing of specific populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and test their impact on their synaptic targets.  One project in the lab is focused on using these combined techniques to map out circuit dynamics in visual cortex &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;A second project is using combined optogenetics and chronic tetrode recordings in awake behaving animals.  We are recording patterns of visually evoked activity during awake visual behavior and testing the impact of changing inhibitory or excitatory activity on visual perception.&lt;br&gt;A third focus is to explore the cellular mechanisms of gain control in the brain. Gain is the amplification of inputs into outputs, and can be thought of as a &#39;volume control&#39; for neurons.  Gain modulation allows neurons to scale their output to any range of incoming inputs.  This process is well documented across the brain, but very little is known about the underlying cellular mechanisms.  We are exploring the role of synchrony between neurons as a mechanism for gain control &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to exploring neural dynamics in the healthy brain, we are also interested in the mechanisms of neural dysregulation during disease.  Using animal models, we are studying the roles that different populations of inhibitory interneurons may play in schizophrenia.  We are also studying the initiation of epilepsy and how it may be controlled with new techniques for regulating neural activity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</ins>

These functions depend on the capability of individual neurons to perform complex computations through the compartmentalization of electrical and biochemical signaling within their dendritic arbors. Our goal is to understand how the dynamic interactions of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs within different subcellular domains influence the activity of single neurons and the local networks in which they participate. By combining an array of methods, including electrophysiology, multiphoton microscopy, and optogenetic manipulation of targeted neuronal populations, we are bridging the gaps between molecular, cellular, and systems neuroscience.

The importance of structural remodeling in the pathogenesis
of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly gaining attention. Specifically,
the development of atrial fibrosis appears to play a major role in the
promotion of AF. Thus identification of individuals at high risk of AF before
the onset of irreversible fibrosis is of utmost importance. We have developed
methods to non-invasively image the molecular processes leading to the
development of fibrosis using targeted imaging of matrix metalloproteinases in
the atrium. Using this technique we are able to non-invasively image the
development of atrial structural remodeling in heart failure before the
development of fibrosis.

Working within the infrastructure of the Yale-New Haven
Hospital/Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (YNHH/CORE), the overall
aim of clinical research is to examine the outcomes of patients with arrhythmias.
Specifically, using data from the ACC NCDR ICD database and Medicare claims, we
are defining the determinants of use of remote monitoring technology in
patients undergoing implantation of defibrillators, as well as the potential
effect of this technology on clinical outcomes. We also have several projects examining
outcomes of patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy.  

The emphasis on quality can be translated to
improved outcomes of challenging cases. The Complex Ablation Program was
established in 2010 and specializes in management of refractory long-standing
persistent AF, epicardial and endocardial ventricular tachycardia, and patients
with structural heart disease. In patients with refractory, long-standing
persistent AF, the 6-month freedom from AF was 78% in patients undergoing AF
ablation

Current research
focuses on 1) Determining the role of H2A.X in
differentiation and cellular reprogramming (iPS cells). H2A.X is a unique
histone variant, which is highly enriched in ES cells.  We are using genomic and biochemistry
approach to investigate the function of H2A.X in transcriptional regulation and
cell fate determination.  2)  Delineating the pathways regulated by H2A.X
and WSTF in embryonic development and its implication in human Williams
syndrome. We are using mouse genetics approach to investigate their functions
in pluripotent neural crest cells and tissue-specific stem cells.  3) Investigating the functions of H2A.X and
WSTF in DNA repair pathways. We are focusing on identifying their functions in
maintaining genome integrity and preventing aberrant transcription.  We welcome young scientists with similar
interests to join us to study these interesting and intriguing questions.</ins>

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ettinger’s research focuses on the effects of environmental exposures on reproductive, perinatal, and children&#39;s health.  She is a formally-trained epidemiologist, and Fellow of the American College of Epidemiology, with interdisciplinary training in biostatistics, environmental health sciences, and human nutrition.  In addition, she completed a Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award in Molecular Epidemiology investigating “Genetic and Epigenetic Modifiers of Maternal-Fetal Transfer of Toxicants &amp; Perinatal Outcomes” (NIH K01 ES014907).  The objective of her work is to understand how common genetic variants, epigenetic events, and dietary nutrients may modify susceptibility to environmental exposures in the maternal-fetal unit and, ultimately, impact toxicant-induced pregnancy and developmental outcomes.  Her research mainly involves the epidemiologic analysis of environmental exposure to toxic metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, manganese, mercury, uranium) and the associated human health effects in several new and ongoing longitudinal pregnancy/birth cohort studies.  She has extensive “on-the-ground” experience in the design, implementation, data management, and analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials investigating the effects of environmental exposures and nutritional interventions on maternal and child health outcomes.  These studies have been carried out in both rural and urban community-based settings working with diverse populations in the U.S. and internationally.  Current studies are being carried out in: Mexico, in collaboration with researchers at the National Institute for Public Health; Canada, in collaboration with Health Canada; and in the U.S. at the Tar Creek Superfund site (Oklahoma) and Navajo Nation.  Her work aims to provide new insights to better understand how environmental risks within and between populations vary with respect to exposure, underlying susceptibility and developmental stage.  Dr. Ettinger’s background also includes applied public health experience working as an Epidemiologist in the federal government (CDC) providing technical assistance to State and local public health departments on the design and implementation of prevention programs and surveillance systems for environmental hazards and health effects.  She recently coordinated the efforts of the CDC Lead and Pregnancy Work Group and was the primary author and co-editor of CDC’s Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention “Guidelines for the Identification and Management of Lead Exposure in Pregnant and Lactating Women” (2010).&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple sclerosis.&lt;/strong&gt; B-cell depletion therapy in MS results in a remarkable reduction in new inflammatory brain lesions and clinical relapses, indicating that B cells contribute to MS pathology. How they do so is not well understood. We have built a program that is focused on furthering the understanding of the role that B cells and antibodies play in the pathology of MS. To this end, my group is investigating the following fundamental questions in MS: &lt;em&gt;What are the antigen targets of MS B cells?&lt;/em&gt; Through the application of novel technologies, we demonstrated that autoantibodies to the encephalogenic myelin antigens, MBP and MOG are uncommon in the serum and CSF of adult patients with MS [1-4]. This turned our interest toward the B cells that accumulate at the site of tissue injury, the MS CNS. Here, we are elucidating the antigen specificity of B cells that reside within MS lesions. Our strategy harnesses the adaptive response of the humoral immune system by using the machinery of the B cells present in these tissues to isolate autoantigens [5]. Laser capture micro-dissection is used to isolate single B cells directly from CNS tissue. Single-cell PCR then amplifies the antibody variable regions, sequencing of which provides information concerning expanded clones and evidence of those that have experienced antigen-driven stimulation. Then, large amounts of recombinant, whole IgG from selected clones are produced. The IgG is then used to capture antigens from candidate sources. The precise molecular definition of isolated antigen(s) is then determined through sophisticated mass spectrometric methodologies. To date, we have isolated and identified a number of candidate autoantigens, validation of which is under way. &lt;em&gt;What is the relationship between the antibodies and the B cells present in the CSF and CNS tissue and to those in the periphery?&lt;/em&gt; While B cells and antibodies are present in the CSF and CNS tissue of patients with MS, the relationship among them is not understood. We have constructed immunoglobulin transcriptomes and proteomes from CNS tissue and CSF that allowed us to determine that these compartmentalized B cells and antibodies are clonally related [6, 7]. We have now turned our attention toward determining how these cells are related to the peripheral B cell repertoire. We are currently using high-throughput sequencing to build immunoglobulin transcriptomes from the cervical lymph nodes, which will be compared to those derived from CNS lesions and the CSF. &lt;em&gt;How do MS CNS B cells function as antigen-presenting cells?&lt;/em&gt; We are developing a model system engineered to examine the role of human MS CNS-derived immunoglobulin in the pathogenic progression of CNS demyelination. Specifically, we will build a mouse model genetically engineered to develop B cells expressing immunoglobulin derived from pervasive human MS CNS clones. This model will allow the study of the contribution that MS CNS-derived immunoglobulin and B cells make to CNS demyelination and tissue injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myasthenia gravis.&lt;/strong&gt; Autoreactive B-cells are thought to play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of MG. Early studies, including one at Yale, indicate that B cell depletion therapy is beneficial to MG patients [8]. It is unclear what specific changes in the immune system are associated with the observed clinical improvement. Accordingly, the rationale for this work is to further understand rituximab’s mechanism of action by measuring its effects on immunity in MG. Molecular and cellular immune system components, which putatively participate in the pathology of MG, will be measured at points prior to, during and after rituximab-mediated B cell depletion. We are developing/adapting immunoassays so that we can measure: Autoantibody titer of MuSK and AChR; Antigen specific B cells and plasma cells; Repertoire and characteristics of antigen specific B cells; Antigen specific T-helper cells; Cytokine profiles of antigen specific T cells. We expect to identify changes in the immune system of MG patients undergoing treatment and these data will be related to measurements of clinical outcome. This work represents a first step toward gaining a more complete understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying treatment of MG with rituximab and will lead to new ways to prevent or treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The inflammatory myopathies&lt;/strong&gt; are a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness associated with inflammatory cell infiltration within the muscle. The muscle mRNA from a subset of IM patients harbors an abundance of Ig transcripts. Although sparse numbers of CD19 or CD20 B cells are present in IM muscle tissue, we reported that large numbers of CD138 plasma cells are present and that these cells are the source of the Ig transcripts. These findings led us to hypothesize that we would find evidence of an Ag-driven immune response in the tissue of patients with particular IMs. Through investigating the B cell and plasma cell Ig repertoire in muscle biopsies we confirmed that such an antigen-driven response was occurring in this autoimmune tissue [9]. We then set out to identify the antigen driving this response using recombinant IgG derived from plasma cells harbored in the muscle tissue. We are currently evaluating the validity of a novel muscle-associated autoantigen isolated using this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our cancer program&lt;/strong&gt; is currently focused on meningiomas and germ cell tumors. These tumors invariably harbor an immune cell infiltrate comprised, in part, of B cells, yet little is known of their role. We are using novel strategies to understand further the characteristics of the B cells commonly found within these tumors. A variety of procedures for the isolation of tumor antigens exist, yet the identification of real and reliable tumor-specific structures is difficult. Thus, our goal is to identify tumor-specific antigen(s) by harnessing the adaptive response of the humoral immune system present in the tumor microenvironment. Such molecular tools represent a sophisticated and reliable strategy both to investigate tumor-associated antibody specificity and to discover novel, tumor-associated antigens that can be used as potential targets in tumor diagnostics or therapeutics. Our work has focused on germ cell tumors, a principal feature of which is that they invariably harbor a prominent immune cell infiltrate. Data collected by our group indicate that germ cell tumors drive tumor-associated B cells toward antibody production that targets specific tumor antigens [10]. To isolate these antigens we have adapted the strategy used in our MS antigen discovery program (described above). The identification of tumor-specific antigens represents a fundamental step toward understanding the biology and the role of the immune system in this tumor family. Moreover, novel tumor antigens may lead to the development of targeted immunotherapy that may be highly efficacious and better tolerated than current treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>Guidance of vascular patterning&lt;br&gt;Specialized endothelial cells (EC) called tip cells located at the extremities of growing capillary sprouts mediate guided vascular patterning.  Tip cells exhibit characteristic features, including extension of filopodia that explore the tip cell environment, lack of a lumen and a slow proliferation rate.  Following behind tip cells, other EC termed stalk cells form the capillary lumen and proliferate.  Tip cell selection is induced by VEGF signaling through VEGFR2.  We and others have shown that tip cells also express high levels of the endothelial-specific Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (Dll4).  Inactivation of one allele of the Dll4 gene in mice and pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling using gamma-secretase inhibitors causes excessive tip cell formation.  Dll4 inactivation leads to alterations in VEGF receptor levels, suggesting that Dll4 negatively regulates the sensitivity of ECs to VEGF and so acts as a ‘brake’ on VEGF signaling during capillary sprouting to ensure that only a limited number of cells form tips. Isolation of EC from dll4+/- mice has allowed us to identify novel tip-cell enriched genes, the function of which we are currently investigating. &lt;br&gt;Capillary sprouting also shows morphological similarities to axon guidance.  Like endothelial tip cells, axonal growth cones extend filopodia that sense and respond to extracellular guidance cues. By screening for the expression of axon guidance molecules in EC, we have identified several key molecules regulating capillary guidance.  The Netrin receptor UNC5B is expressed in arterial EC and in tip cells.  Loss of function of Unc5b in mouse and zebrafish embryos leads to ectopic filopodial extension from endothelial tip cells and excessive blood vessel branching.  Treatment of endothelial tip cells with the UNC5B ligand Netrin-1 leads to filopodial retraction, an effect that is lost in Unc5b mutants.  UNC5B thus functions as a repulsive guidance receptor controlling morphogenesis of the vascular system.  The capacity to direct blood vessel growth may have important therapeutic implications for the anti-angiogenic treatment of solid tumors. We are currently studying a novel UNC5B ligand that we have identified.&lt;br&gt;My group has also shown the selective expression of the VEGF co-receptors Neuropilin (Nrp) in EC of arteries (Nrp1) and of veins/lymphatics (Nrp2). Homozygous Nrp2 mutant embryos exhibit selective defects in the formation of lymphatic vessels, while their veins and arteries form normally.  Lymphatic vessels are aberrantly positioned and enlarge rather than form branches. Antibodies blocking VEGF-C binding to Nrp2 and Nrp2-Vegfr3 double heterozygous mice reproduce these defects, indicating that binding of VEGF to Nrp2 and signal transduction through VEGFR3 mediate lymphatic vessel sprouting. We have generated transgenic mice expressing GFP in their lymphatic vessels to analyze live lymphatic vessel development in normal and mutant animals by multiphoton imaging. &lt;br&gt;Vascular endothelial growth factors including VEGF-C also regulate development of certain neuronal cell types. We are using targeted inactivation of Vegfr3 in neural cells to understand VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling in the nervous system.

For example, Salmonella experiences a variety of environments during infection of animal hosts, including an acid pH in the stomach, low oxygen and high osmolarity in the small intestine, and for those Salmonella serovars that cause systemic disease, the nutrient-poor and microbicidal-compound-rich milieu of the macrophage phagosome. Because it can replicate both inside and outside host tissues, Salmonella has the means to ascertain whether it is present in an intracellular or extracellular environment and to promote expression of the appropriate set of genes. Two-component systems typically consist of an integral membrane sensor and a DNA-binding regulator. Sensors respond to the presence of their specific signal(s) by modifying the phosphorylation state of their cognate regulatory proteins, which bind to their DNA targets only when phosphorylated. We have been investigating the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system, a governor of virulence and the adaptation to Mg2+-limiting environments in several bacterial species, and the PmrA/PmrB system, the major controller of modifications of the outermost layer of the bacterial outer membrane. The PhoQ protein is a Mg2+ sensor that promotes the phosphorylated state of the regulator PhoP when experiencing low Mg2+, whereas the sensor PmrB responds to the presence of Fe3+, Al3+, or acid pH by promoting the phosphorylated state of the PmrA protein. We determined that, surprisingly, the level of phosphorylated regulator changes dynamically even under constant inducing conditions, whereby activation of a two-component system results in a surge of activity before the system reaches steady state. The surge of the PhoP/PhoQ system is critical for Salmonella&#39;s ability to cause a disease because a Salmonella strain engineered to reach the same steady state monotonically (i.e., without the surge) was attenuated for virulence. These results demonstrate that organisms care not only about the particular activation level that is achieved in response to a given signal but also about how that activation level is reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differential Gene Control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA-binding regulatory proteins often control expression of more than one gene, which may encode products that are required in different amounts. This raises a question: How does a given regulator achieve differential expression of its coregulated targets? To address this question, we developed GPS (gene promoter scan), a computational method that discriminates among coregulated promoters by simultaneously considering multiple cis-acting promoter features. The use of GPS has enabled the discovery of novel targets of regulation of the PhoP protein, as well as regulatory interactions that could not be uncovered using previous approaches. In addition to controlling genes directly, the PhoP protein utilizes a variety of mechanisms to regulate gene expression indirectly, via other systems and proteins. On the one hand, the PhoP-activated PmrD protein activates the PmrA protein when the signals for the PmrB protein are absent. This allows genes regulated by the PmrA protein to be expressed in low Mg2+, which is the signal activating the PhoQ protein. On the other hand, the PhoP-activated IraP protein promotes an increase in the level of the alternative sigma factor RpoS, thereby promoting expression of RpoS-dependent genes when bacteria experience the low-Mg2+ signal that activates the PhoP/PhoQ system. We refer to PmrD and IraP as connector proteins because they connect the signal sensed by one system with the output mediated by a different system. The kinetic and quantitative properties of the regulatory circuits mediated by connector proteins are different from those in which the PhoP protein functionsas a direct activator. Certain PhoP-activated genes are also regulated after the initiation of gene transcription, which provides an additional means of differential gene control. For example, we determined that the leader region of the PhoP-activated Mg2+ transporter mgtA gene functions as a Mg2+ sensor that determines whether transcription continues into the mgtA-coding region and the MgtA protein is made. The Mg2+ sensor in the mgtA mRNA enables bacteria to exert separate control over determinants governing cytoplasmic Mg2+ homeostasis (i.e., a Mg2+ transporter) versus extracytoplasmic Mg2+ homeostasis (i.e., enzymes that modify Mg2+-binding sites in the cell envelope) when they are all transcriptionally regulated by the PhoP/PhoQ system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Genetic Basis for the Phenotypic Differences between Related Bacterial Species&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closely related bacterial species often display different responses to a given environment. This can be due to the presence/absence of species-specific genes, the differential regulation of the same set of genes, or allelic differences between homologous genes. We have been investigating the genetic basis for the differences that exist between the pathogenic species S. enterica and Y. pestis as well as the gut commensal bacterium E. coli. We are particularly interested in the differences that originate from the differential gene regulation of shared genes, as well as the mechanisms by which newly acquired genes are integrated into ancestral regulatory circuits. E. coli has PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB systems that are closely related to those present in Salmonella and that respond to the same signals. However, the PmrD protein of E. coli is highly divergent and thus unable to mediate the low-Mg2+ activation of PmrA-regulated genes mediated by the Salmonella PmrD protein. Furthermore, E. coli and Salmonella encode highly conserved IraP proteins that can substitute for one another to promote activation of RpoS-regulated genes. The E. coliiraP gene does not, however, activate RpoS in low Mg2+ because its iraP promoter lacks the PhoP-binding site that enables PhoP-dependent iraP expression in Salmonella. Even though it lacks the pmrD gene, Y. pestis can express PmrA-activated genes in low Mg2+ because it harbors binding sites for the transcription factor PhoP in the targets of PmrA control. This indicates that related bacterial species often adopt distinct regulatory circuits to express shared genes. While qualitatively similar, these circuits often display quantitatively different outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

 Our laboratory is interested in uncovering the fundamental 
 rules governing bacterial signal transduction. We investigate the regulatory 
 systems that govern the ability of pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria to prosper 
 in mammalian tissues. This research is helping us understand how certain bacteria 
 cause disease and others establish productive interactions with eukaryotic 
 hosts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GENETIC NETWORKS CONTROLLING BACTERIAL VIRULENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is a major regulator 
 of virulence functions and Mg2+ homeostasis in enteric bacteria. The Mg2+ 
 sensor PhoQ modifies the phosphorylated state of the regulatory protein PhoP 
 thereby affecting PhoP’s ability to bind to its target promoters and 
 modify gene transcription. In the pathogenic bacterium Salmonella enterica 
 serovar Typhimurium, PhoP controls genes directly and via other regulatory 
 proteins that PhoP, or a PhoP-activated gene product(s), activates at the 
 transcriptional, post-transcriptional or post-translational levels.


 
 
 
 We are presently exploring the signals that modulate 
 two-component systems in the various tissues experienced during infection, 
 how two-component systems function, how bacteria integrate signals perceived 
 by independent regulatory systems, how a transcription factor achieves differential 
 expression of its target genes, and mechanisms of RNA-mediated gene control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVOLUTION OF BACTERIAL REGULONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The phenotypic differences that distinguish closely 
 related bacterial species result from differences in gene content, in the 
 regulation of shared genes and/or in the particular alleles of shared genes. 
 We have been investigating how target genes controlled by orthologous transcription 
 factors can differ among closely organisms. This could be due to differences 
 in gene content resulting from gene acquisition and/or gene loss, to changes 
 in the regulatory proteins themselves and/or in the promoters they regulate. 
 This is in addition to the utilization of different regulatory architectures 
 to control expression conserved target genes, which can result in kinetic 
 and quantitative differences in gene expression.
 
 

 
 
 We are examining the structure, properties and evolution 
 of regulatory circuits and promoter architectures in enteric bacteria.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;     Co-signaling molecules with costimulatory and coinhibitory functions are essential for T cell communication with virtually all other host cells. During cell-to-cell contact, a specific recognition occurs between co-signaling receptors and ligands, which triggers intracellular biochemical signals that lead to the generation of immunological functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     One hallmark of co-signaling molecules is that their function entirely depends on T cell receptor (TCR) signals. Co-signals positively and negatively control and modulate the initiation, expansion, functional maturation and execution, survival, and termination of T cell responses. The majority of co-signaling molecules are members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamilies. Our laboratory has identified a series of co-signaling molecules in both the B7-CD28 family (B7-H1/PD-L1, B7-H2/ICOSL, B7-DC/PD-L2, B7-H3 and B7-H4/B7x/B7S1) and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily (CD137, LIGHT/HVEM) and characterized their biochemical pathways and immunological functions. We use monoclonal antibodies, recombinant co-signaling molecules, and gene knockouts to specifically manipulate co-signaling molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Using mouse models, we have demonstrated the role of these co-signaling molecules in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, viral infections, and transplantation rejection. We have also developed several monoclonal antibodies which specifically stimulate (CD137) or inhibit (B7-H1, B7-H4) co-signaling molecule functions. These studies have laid the foundation for clinical trials that treat advanced cancer patients (anti-B7-H1/PD-L1, anti-PD-1, anti-CD137 antibodies) and autoimmune diseases (B7-H4Ig fusion protein). Ample evidence now supports that new strategies can be developed by precisely manipulating these cell surface molecular pathways to selectively block or promote T cell immunity &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; as an approach to treat human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, our laboratory is focusing on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The identification and characterization of new cell surface co-signaling molecules that control T cell priming, expansion, differentiation, memory, and survival:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We have developed a Receptor Array system that rapidly identifies cell surface receptor-ligand interactions (Yao et al, Immunity, 2011). In combination with bioinformatic analysis, we perform genome-wide searches for new receptor-ligand interactions that are expressed during specific stages of T cell activation in response to antigen. These newly identified receptor-ligands will then be further characterized for their immunological function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The identification of intracellular biochemical pathways which determine the functional outcome of cell surface co-signaling:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It is often difficult to interpret functional outcomes with specific intracellular signaling pathways due to the diverse effects that co-signaling can have on immune cells. We are developing new approaches to dissect complex signaling pathways that link cell surface co-signaling to extracellular immunological functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dissecting the mechanisms by which tumors escape the immune response:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We are interested in the cellular and molecular mechanisms that determine a successful vs. a failed immune response in both animal models and human specimens, especially in the context of clinical trials that block the B7-H1/PD-1 pathway to treat human cancers.&lt;/li&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My research has focused on breast cancer and while it spans the spectrum of inquiry related to this disease process, the majority of it falls into several large themes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chest Wall Recurrence:  I began to become very interested in chest wall recurrences (CWR) after mastectomy and did a number of studies in this area.  Several findings were key and were significant contributions to the literature and in fact were practice changing.  &lt;br /&gt;(i)  Prognosis:  While it had previously been thought that all patients with CWR had a dismal prognosis, I was able to define a group in whom prognosis was not poor, and in whom aggressive management was warranted.  I developed a clinical prediction model to assess prognosis in these patients.  This is now widely used, and was quoted by every speaker in a plenary session at the American College of Surgeons on the management of CWR.  &lt;br /&gt;(ii)  Reconstruction:  I was able to demonstrate that patients who develop a CWR after having had breast reconstruction did not need to have their reconstruction taken down.  This finding which allowed many women to maintain their reconstruction despite having a CWR won the best poster award at the Southwestern Surgical Congress.  &lt;br /&gt;(iii)Radiation:  I defined not only the need for radiation therapy after CWR, but also added to the literature findings to support the use of post-mastectomy radiation therapy, which has now become widely accepted and supported by ASCO and ASTRO guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy:  Much of my work has focused on various issues surrounding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the management of breast cancer patients.  I validated the subareolar injection technique in the world’s largest series (4131 patients); this is now considered by many to be the optimal injection technique for SLNB.  I elucidated, in one of the most widely quoted studies, the association between immunohistochemically detected sentinel node deposits and prognosis, a study which won me an ASCO Merit Award.  I identified factors associated with a failure to identify a sentinel lymph node, which has encouraged surgeons to use dual tracer technique to optimize identification rates.  I explored the use of lymphoscintigraphy and the finding of internal mammary nodes (IMN), finding that positive IMN nodes frequently do not change prognosis or management – this is one of the oft-quoted studies for why many surgeons do not routinely use lymphoscintigraphy or do IMN biopsies.  I published that there was no difference in SLN-positivity rates based on biopsy type – a study that contradicted the myth that core needle biopsy could spread cancer cells into lymph nodes.  This was important as excisional biopsy is now considered suboptimal, and needle biopsies are favored.  Having an extensive background in SLNB, I acquired skills in clinical prediction modeling through my MPH at Harvard, and created a number of clinical prediction rules which have now been validated in a number of studies.  I consider these seminal contributions to the literature, as these prediction rules allow for the prediction of (i) non-sentinel node metastases in SLN-positive patients using preoperative and intraoperative factors alone, (ii) the finding of four or more positive SLNs in patients with tumors &lt; 5 cm and 1-3 positive SLNs, as these patients are at risk of requiring post-mastectomy radiation therapy and this prediction model (which again is based on preoperative and intraoperative factors) may alter decision-making for immediate breast reconstruction, and (iii) the finding of any positive node in a cohort of elderly patients as these are patients in whom comorbidities may cause risks to outweigh benefits of SLNB if the risk of a positive node is low.  Previous prediction models of non-sentinel node metastases had always used postoperative final pathologic data, which did not aid intraoperative decision-making.  Our models, however, relied only on data available to the surgeon at this time point, and formed the basis of an NIH grant which was designed to strengthen these models using intraoperative RT-PCR based data. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mammography and Screening in Population-Based Studies:  I have worked extensively with the National Health Interview Survey to understand trends in mammography and screening in the US population.  I was one of the first to demonstrate that the recent decline in breast cancer incidence rates was not due solely to a reduction in hormone replacement therapy use, but also to a decline in mammography screening.  I defined the use of mammography in various racial cohorts, and analyzed mammography usage based on risk stratifications.  This work was cited by the US Preventative Services Task Force in their review of significant literature in their recent 2010 position statement regarding screening mammography. &#183; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other:  I have been interested in a potpourri of other studies, from identifying biomarkers in nipple aspirate fluid, to understanding the prognostic significance of concomitant DCIS in patients with invasive cancer (a study which won the best paper award at the Central Surgical Association meeting).    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My laboratory investigates blood vessel morphogenesis, the maintenance of the adult blood vessel and diseases of the vasculature. To this end, we utilize fundamental biochemical, genetic and developmental biological approaches. We initially investigated the origins of the smooth muscle and adventitial cells of the pulmonary artery and have delineated with cellular resolution the patterns of cell differentiation, proliferation, recruitment and migration in the developing pulmonary arterial wall. Furthermore, we have initiated a genetic dissection of the molecular processes and signals that underlie blood vessel formation and have demonstrated a role of the platelet derived growth factor pathway in this process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Our ongoing and planned studies of vessel development, maintenance and disease use similar fundamental approaches. For instance, we are studying the morphogenesis of the walls of other vessels, such as the aorta and cerebral vasculature, and comparing and contrasting their morphogenesis with that of the pulmonary artery. In addition, little is known about the maintenance of blood vessels, and we are embarking on a study to evaluate the patterns of cell turnover, proliferation and migration as well as the underlying mechanisms in the adult vessel wall. Moreover, diseases of the vasculature are thought to largely involve a recapitulation of developmental programs, and we are applying our approaches to study animal models of vascular diseases that involve ectopic and aberrant smooth muscle cells, such as pulmonary artery hypertension, atherosclerosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis, restenosis and intracranial hemorrhage. Finally, we are studying clinical samples obtained from patients with vascular diseases and relating them to our findings in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Research Projects:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Thrombus Resolution on Ultrasound as a Guide to Anticoagulation Therapy for Provoked Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (TRU-DVT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a prospective pilot study looking at provoked deep vein thrombosis resulting from trauma, surgery, and short-term immobilization. Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis is typically treated for 3 months with anticoagulation. This trial attempts to treat patients with DVT due to a reversible factor for one month instead of 3 months. The study is enrolling patients currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Guideline Implementation in treating lower extremity Deep vein thrombosis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Periodically, the American college of chest physicians (ACCP) publishes guidelines for treatment of deep vein thrombosis. In real practice, the guidelines are not always strictly followed and treatment may vary depending on the hospital and the provider. This study aims at looking at the modalities of treatment of DVT at Yale New Haven Hospital and assess for the implementation of ACCP guidelines among different providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Retrieval of IVC filters: the patients’ perspective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are placed in a select patient population who develop deep vein thrombosis and have contraindication for anticoagulation to prevent development of pulmonary embolism. Most IVC filters are retrievable and should be removed after the risk period resolves because they can cause long-term complications (thrombosis, perforation, migration) when left for a prolonged period of time. This project aims at conducting a questionnaire with the patients that were lost to follow up and did not have retrieval of the IVC filter. The goal is to assess possible reasons for loss of follow up and find ways to improve compliance with the FDA recommendations to retrieve the IVC filter when risk of pulmonary embolism resolves. This study is enrolling patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project 4:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Endovascular IVC filter retriever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are placed in a select patient population who develop deep vein thrombosis and have contraindication for anticoagulation to prevent development of pulmonary embolism. Despite the FDA recommendation to retrieve the IVC filters after the period of risk is resolved, a significant proportion of patients fail to follow up. They frequently present with late complications (thrombosis, perforation migration). Delayed retrieval is very challenging because of tilting or scarring of the struts of the device in the wall of the IVC. There are no devices on the market that are dedicated for that task. In collaboration with Yale school of engineering, design of a new retrieving tool is being developed. The medical student will help with the initial in vitro / animal trialing of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project 5:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; IVC filter removal: survey of vascular specialist practice patterns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description: &lt;/strong&gt;Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are placed in a select patient population who develop deep vein thrombosis and have contraindication for anticoagulation to prevent development of pulmonary embolism. The FDA recommends retrieval of the IVC filter from patients deemed not at risk for pulmonary embolism any more. However, there is no consensus in the community of vascular specialist on when is the best time to retrieve IVC filters and how aggressive to be in removing them when they are “stuck” and not retrieved easily. This project will administer a survey to vascular specialists about their practice pattern with respect to retrieval of IVC filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Impact of distal embolization during catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy for lower extremity ischemia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Thrombosis of a lower extremity bypass remains a major challenge for vascular surgeons and a reason for limb loss. Most of bypass thrombosis are treated with catheter directed thrombolysis (administration of alteplase into the thrombus using an infusion catheter). The incidence of embolization (dislodgement of thrombus to block more distal arteries) during thrombolytic therapy and its effect on overall outcomes have not been studies in the literature. This study aims at finding the incidence of distal embolization and its impact on bypass patency and limb loss. Also, evaluate the effectiveness of repeat catheter directed thrombolysis and its long-term outcomes. This project is best for medical students who had some exposure to vascular surgery and have interest in the specialty. (Third and fourth years)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project 7:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; May Thurner syndrome – review of the world’s Literature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; May Thurner syndrome is a relatively rare entity where the right iliac artery compresses the left iliac vein at the bifurcation of the Aorta and Inferior vena cava. That can lead to stenosis of the iliac vein, swelling of the left leg and sometimes deep vein thrombosis. The literature has mostly case reports describing this entity and different modalities of treatment. The project involves review of the cases available in the literature and summary of patient demographics, presentation and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project 8:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking cessation in vascular patients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking is very prevalent in patients with vascular disease. Patients get advised about smoking cessation all the time. This study is a randomized study to look at whether referring the vascular patients to a smoking cessation clinic would improve the smoking cessation rate compared to just regular reminders and advice during vascular surgery follow up visits. There will be also a survey of the patients to assess for factors associated with success and failure in smoking cessation.&lt;/p&gt;</ins>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN VIVO IMAGING:&lt;/strong&gt;The majority of projects in the laboratory are imaging-oriented. We use a variety of techniques including transcranial in vivo two photon microscopy, high-resolution confocal, spectral confocal reflectance microscopy (SCoRe) and electron microscopy in combination with differential fluorescent cell labeling and genetic/pharmacological manipulations. We aim at developeing novel imaging strategies and methods to better understand the pathophysiology of a variety of neurological disorders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEURODEGENERATION:&lt;/strong&gt; understanding the dynamics of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease. We study the interactions between microglia, neurons and amyloid plaques to understand the sequence of events leading to neural dysfunction in AD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICROVASCULAR PLASTICITY:&lt;/strong&gt; microvascular recanalization and angioplasticity after cerebral embolic occlusion. We have recently described a new mechanism of microvascular plasticity which leads to vessel recanalization (Angiophagy). We are investigating the molecular control and physiological relevance of this novel mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;NEUROVASCULAR UNIT&quot; FUNCTION AND PATHOLOGY:&lt;/strong&gt; neurovascular coupling, tissue oxygenation. Development and disruption of the neurovascular unit. Understanding how neurons and astrocytes adapt to metabolic challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AXON AND SYNAPSE DEGENERATION/REGENERATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Wa have recently developed a method for imaging myelinated axons in vivo (Spectral confocal reflectance microscopy SCoRe), which we are currently using to explore questions related to myelin&#39;s role in regeneration and degeneration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN VIVO IMAGING:&lt;/strong&gt;The majority of projects in the laboratory are imaging-oriented. We use a variety of techniques including transcranial in vivo two photon microscopy, high-resolution confocal, spectral confocal reflectance microscopy (SCoRe) and electron microscopy in combination with differential fluorescent cell labeling and genetic/pharmacological manipulations. We aim at developeing novel imaging strategies and methods to better understand the pathophysiology of a variety of neurological disorders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEURODEGENERATION:&lt;/strong&gt; understanding the dynamics of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease. We study the interactions between microglia, neurons and amyloid plaques to understand the sequence of events leading to neural dysfunction in AD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICROVASCULAR PLASTICITY:&lt;/strong&gt; microvascular recanalization and angioplasticity after cerebral embolic occlusion. We have recently described a new mechanism of microvascular plasticity which leads to vessel recanalization (Angiophagy). We are investigating the molecular control and physiological relevance of this novel mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;NEUROVASCULAR UNIT&quot; FUNCTION AND PATHOLOGY:&lt;/strong&gt; neurovascular coupling, tissue oxygenation. Development and disruption of the neurovascular unit. Understanding how neurons and astrocytes adapt to metabolic challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AXON AND SYNAPSE DEGENERATION/REGENERATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Wa have recently developed a method for imaging myelinated axons in vivo (Spectral confocal reflectance microscopy SCoRe), which we are currently using to explore questions related to myelin&#39;s role in regeneration and degeneration.&lt;/li&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My program of research is aimed at characterizing genetic and environmental contributions to pathways of substance use and misuse from adolescence to young adulthood. This developmental period is marked by major role shifts and changes in interpersonal functioning and is also the period of peak problem substance use. The divergence in paths between heavy drinkers who mature out and those who go on to develop more chronic alcohol-related problems occurs in this developmental stage known as emerging adulthood. Identifying the factors that contribute to various trajectories of substance use, and in particular of alcohol use, is a major goal of my research. Taking a developmental psychopathology approach to the study of substance use disorders is key to capturing the dynamic processes that influence their course. I have applied this perspective by studying substance use disorder development with respect to stages of use (e.g., initiation, onset of substance-related problems). Much of my work has focused on a less commonly studied characteristic of drinking course, the rate of progression between stages of use. This phenotype captures an aspect of the course of substance use that cannot be gleaned from simply studying influences on whether a given stage of use is reached. For example, early age at first drink is a strong predictor of alcohol use disorders, but early drinkers take longer to transition from first drink to dependence than later initiators. Distinctions by stage in the relative contribution of various psychiatric and psychosocial risk factors have been found in both alcohol and nicotine dependence development. Parental divorce and ADHD, for instance, play a more significant role in initiation than in the rate of progression from initiation to problem use, whereas use of other substances is more strongly associated with progression to problem use than initiation. Recognition of these differences can lead to improvements in stage-specific prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics Much of my work on substance use disorders has made use of twin samples. Twin modeling can be applied to estimate the relative genetic and environmental contributions to a given phenotype by comparing the similarity of the phenotype of interest in monozygotic (MZ, i.e. identical) twin pairs to the similarity in dizygotic (DZ, i.e., fraternal) twin pairs, with greater similarity in MZ’s suggesting a substantial heritable influence on the phenotype. Twin studies have demonstrated a modest heritable contribution to initiation of substance use, which is shaped to a significant degree by environmental influences common to members of a twin pair (e.g., shared peers, parenting practices). Progression to problem use, by contrast, is influenced in about equal parts by genetics and environmental factors specific to an individual (e.g., traumatic event), with little to no shared environmental contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trauma My research interests include the association between trauma exposure and substance use disorders, and in particular, the role of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) in the manifestation of familial risk for alcohol-related problems in women. Rates of CSA are elevated in offspring of alcoholic parents, likely due to common risk factors such as poor parental supervision. Adolescent girls and young women with histories of CSA have often been exposed to a constellation of risk factors, such as parental separation and trauma-related psychopathology (e.g., PTSD, depression) in addition to genetic risk for alcohol use disorders. Disentangling this complex pathway is an important step toward reducing risk for substance use disorders in this high-risk population.  &lt;/p&gt;

A role for BRCA2 in DNA repair was
originally established based on its interaction with RAD51, a key player in HR.
 RAD51 plays a central role in
recombination, assembling onto single-stranded DNA as a nucleoprotein filament,
and catalyzing the invasion and exchange of homologous DNA sequences.  A major hurdle in any biochemical study
is to purify the protein of interest to homogeneity in an active state.  At 384 kDa, BRCA2 is a large protein that has
proven difficult to purify.  Recently, we
have successfully developed a method to purify the full-length protein from
human cells.  We initially characterized BRCA2’s
ability to bind DNA substrates, protein partners involved in homologous
recombination, and its capability to catalyze DNA strand exchange, an in
vitro measure of recombination.  Our
findings revealed that BRCA2 binds RAD51 with a defined stoichiometry, prevents
nucleation onto dsDNA, and enforces binding of RAD51 onto ssDNA thus stabilizing
the nascent nucleoprotein filament.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

   

A major focus of the lab is to
understand the role BRCA2 plays in the DSB response as well as its role in
homologous recombination (HR). 
Homologous recombination is a high fidelity form of DSB repair utilizing
substrates such as the sister chromatid after DNA replication to repair a break
with restoration of the original DNA sequence. 
Other pathways for DSB repair, such as non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ), operate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and can be
deleterious if sequence information is deleted or altered at the break. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;       In order to better understand how
BRCA2 and other players in HR signal and catalyze repair reactions, we are
using a multi-disciplinary approach encompassing biochemistry, genetics, cell
biology, structural biology, and proteomics. 
We are currently using human cells to both express and purify many of
the proteins involved in HR to further understand detailed mechanisms of
action.  We can then look at enzymatic
activities biochemically such as DNA binding preferences, direct protein
interactions, and DNA strand exchange activity. 
Several proteins participate in the HR process and many of the players, such
as the RAD51 paralogs, remain ill-defined as to what exact role they are
playing.  BRCA2 itself interacts with
several proteins:  PALB2, BRCA1, FANCD2,
EMSY, DMC1, DSS1 and it is unclear how these interacting partners influence HR.  Our goal is to understand the functional
consequences of these interactions and how disruptions in the HR pathway lead
to cancer.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.  Targeting Transcription Factors: CREB as a Novel Target for Cancer Treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CREB and NF-kB transcription factors have been implicated as linkers of inflammation and cancer. We tested our hypothesis that CREB is a master regulator and critical linker of inflammation and cancer and found that: 1) CREB is important for normal differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells (&lt;em&gt;Mol Biol Cell&lt;/em&gt; 2006; &lt;em&gt;Mol Cell Biol&lt;/em&gt; 2007); 2) CREB is involved in overexpression of numerous proinflammatory cytokines and proangiogenic chemokines (&lt;em&gt;Cancer Prev Res&lt;/em&gt; 2008); 3) CREB is overexpressed in various human cancers, such as lung, head and neck, breast, brain, prostate, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer (unpublished data); 4) overexpression of CREB is associated with negative prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (&lt;em&gt;Cancer Res&lt;/em&gt; 2008a); 5) suppression of CREB expression and activity inhibits growth and survival of NSCLC cells (&lt;em&gt;Cancer Res&lt;/em&gt; 2008b); and 6) inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin (PG)E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PGF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; activate CREB via the PKA and PKC pathways (&lt;em&gt;J Immunol&lt;/em&gt; 2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that CREB plays a crucial role in both normal physiologic function (normal mucous cell differentiation) and pathologic progression of lung disease (inflammatory lung response and lung tumorigenesis/carcinogenesis).  Our findings have demonstrated that overexpression and activation of CREB can result in prolonged overexpression of mediators that sustain chronic lung inflammation and cause abnormal survival and proliferation of metaplastic and/or premalignant bronchial epithelial cells, and ultimately promote lung cancer development. These results warrant further studies testing CREB as a potential novel target for prevention of and therapy for cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation and Cancer: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting Signal Transduction Networks from Chemokine Receptor to Transcription Factors (CREB and NF-kB) for Cancer Prevention and Treatment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently reported that pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1b induces overexpression of pro-angiogenic CXCL5 and IL-8 (CXCL8) chemokines via CREB and NF-kB transactivation. Blocking these chemokines’ cognate receptor, CXCR2, using a neutralizing antibody or small molecule inhibitor targeting CREB activity completely blocked migration of endothelial cells (&lt;em&gt;Cancer Prev Res&lt;/em&gt; 2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CXCR2 plays an important role in inflammation, and stimulation of CXCR2-expressing endothelial cells by CXC family chemokines promotes angiogenesis. Our recent study aimed to elucidate the expression of CXCR2 by tumor cells and its impact on prognosis in NSCLC, in order to further determine the role of CXCR2 in lung carcinogenesis. We determined CXCR2 expression using immunohistochemistry in a large tissue microarray that included 458 NSCLC samples. We found that high CXCR2 expression was associated with overall survival (HR 1.465; CI=1.088-1.972, p-value=0.012) and that a trend was observed between high CXCR2 expression and recurrence-free survival (HR 1.261; CI=0.973-1.633, p-value=0.080) in a multicovariate Cox proportional hazards model after adjusting for age, gender, histologic type, stage, and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, in a separate study gene expression distributions of CXCR2 and its chemokine ligands were strikingly similar in NSCLC cell lines and lung adenocarcinoma tissue (442 patients’ samples). In both cases, hierarchical clustering showed a cluster mostly driven by CXCR2, CXCL5, and CXCL7, representing 20% of the samples. Principal component analysis showed that KRAS and NF-kB oncogenic pathways were the top two gene sets associated with those 20% of patients. Interestingly, those patients turned out to be associated with a poor overall survival in 442 lung adenocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, CXCR2 expression in NSCLC tumor cells is frequent and associated with an adverse outcome. The CXCR2/CXCL ligands biological axis may be associated with an activation of the KRAS and NF-kB pathways and could lead to a new therapeutic and preventive method for lung adenocarcinoma. These studies may lead to a new therapeutic option to target angiogenesis (particularly, VEGF/VEGFR-independent angiogenesis) using antibodies and/or small molecule inhibitors that block CXCR2 and/or CREB activity, respectively (Manuscript in Review).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.  Cancer Prevention: Characterization of Epithelial Preneoplasia, and Identification of Novel Targets for Cancer Prevention and Biomarkers for Early Detection of Lung Cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronchial epithelial cells are the front line of defense in protecting vulnerable lung tissue from airborne pathogens, and they are also the origin of lung cancer. However, epithelial cells under chronic inflammation develop abnormally differentiated epithelium including mucous cell metaplasia, squamous metaplasia, hyperplasia, and dysplasia, and eventually carcinoma in situ.  Mucous cell metaplasia in the airway mucosa is known to be the production source of uncontrollable amounts of mucus. Severe mucus hypersecretion can cause death by obstructing airways. Our studies showed that CREB is involved in the regulation of mucin expression and normal mucous cell differentiation (&lt;em&gt;Mol Biol Cell&lt;/em&gt; 2006; &lt;em&gt;Mol Cell Biol&lt;/em&gt; 2007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using primary normal human tracheobronchial epithelial (NHTBE) cells cultured by the 3-dimensional organotypic method, we found that the EGFR ligands EGF, TGF-a, and amphiregulin induce hyperplasia, as determined by cell proliferation and formation of multilayered epithelium. We also found that EGF induced the increased expression of cyclin D1, which plays a critical role in bronchial hyperplasia, and the overexpression was mediated by activating the MAPK pathway. Erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and U0126, a MEK inhibitor, completely inhibited EGF-induced hyperplasia. In conclusion, we demonstrated that bronchial hyperplasia can be modeled &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; using primary NHTBE cells maintained in a 3D organotypic culture. Inhibitors of EGFR and MEK completely blocked EGF-induced bronchial hyperplasia, suggesting chemopreventive roles of these inhibitors (&lt;em&gt;Cancer Res&lt;/em&gt; 2007, cover highlight;&lt;em&gt; Cancer Prev Res&lt;/em&gt;, 2011).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also focusing on elucidation of the differential roles of CREB throughout the spectrum from normal epithelial differentiation to inflammatory changes and then to carcinogenesis. Findings from this work will delineate CREB’s crucial role in linking physiologic functions of CREB to pathophysiological progression in the lung, including perturbed inflammatory responses and lung tumorigenesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken all together, our findings unequivocally demonstrate that CREB plays a crucial role in the physiology and pathobiology of airway epithelial cells.  Our studies have provided the first significant evidence that CREB has potential as a new molecular target for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory lung diseases and lung cancer, diseases that have had few breakthroughs or improvements in treatment options or outcomes over the last few decades.  This is a new paradigm in that CREB is seen as a critical link between normal differentiation, inflammation, and lung cancer development. Identification of the role of CREB throughout the spectrum of normal epithelial differentiation, inflammation, and carcinogenesis in the lung is a unique aspect of my laboratory’s research program. In the future, I will continue to comprehensively investigate this new paradigm, which may lead to development of novel therapeutic methods for chronic lung inflammation and lung carcinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.     &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal Physiologic Differentiation of Bronchial Epithelial Cells &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physiologic function of bronchial epithelial cells present in the lung with inflammatory diseases, such as COPD, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer, is often compromised. Mechanisms by which normal mucociliary differentiated bronchial epithelium is maintained and by which aberrant differentiation of bronchial epithelium develops are not known (&lt;em&gt;Mol Biol Cell&lt;/em&gt; 2006; &lt;em&gt;Mol Cell Biol&lt;/em&gt; 2007). Understanding the differentiation mechanism of bronchial epithelial cells would provide important knowledge and novel targets for prevention and treatment of lung diseases.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We showed that CREB has a novel role in airway epithelial cells under both physiologic and pathobiologic conditions. Specifically,under physiologic conditions,CREB plays a critical role in the expression of the &lt;em&gt;MUC5AC&lt;/em&gt; mucous cell-specific marker gene and in normal differentiation of airway epithelial cells. Under pathobiologic conditions, persistent activation of CREB by inflammatory mediators such as the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1b and prostaglandins plays a critical role in the overexpression of &lt;em&gt;MUC5AC, &lt;/em&gt;mucous cell metaplasia, and resulting mucus hypersecretion (&lt;em&gt;J Immunol&lt;/em&gt; 2009). Further studies showed that the PKC/MEK/ERK/p90RSK/CREB pathway is the major signaling cascade in which these stimuli activate CREB. On the other hand, squamous metaplasia in the bronchial epithelium lacks expression of CREB. Thus, it is apparent that CREB is playing dual roles in physiology and pathobiology in the lung. In addition, altered expression and activation of molecules in the signaling pathway have been implicated in carcinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the precise mechanism by which the CREB signaling pathway system regulates normal differentiation mechanisms of bronchial epithelial cells. Abnormally differentiated bronchial epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of several lung diseases, including COPD, asthma, emphysema, and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

Erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and U0126, a MEK inhibitor, completely inhibited EGF-induced hyperplasia. In conclusion, we demonstrated that bronchial hyperplasia can be modeled &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; using primary NHTBE cells maintained in a 3D organotypic culture. Inhibitors of EGFR and MEK completely blocked EGF-induced bronchial hyperplasia, suggesting chemopreventive roles of these inhibitors (&lt;em&gt;Cancer Res&lt;/em&gt; 2007, cover highlight;&lt;em&gt; Cancer Prev Res&lt;/em&gt;, 2011).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also focusing on elucidation of the differential roles of CREB throughout the spectrum from normal epithelial differentiation to inflammatory changes and then to carcinogenesis. Findings from this work will delineate CREB’s crucial role in linking physiologic functions of CREB to pathophysiological progression in the lung, including perturbed inflammatory responses and lung tumorigenesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken all together, our findings unequivocally demonstrate that CREB plays a crucial role in the physiology and pathobiology of airway epithelial cells.  Our studies have provided the first significant evidence that CREB has potential as a new molecular target for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory lung diseases and lung cancer, diseases that have had few breakthroughs or improvements in treatment options or outcomes over the last few decades.  This is a new paradigm in that CREB is seen as a critical link between normal differentiation, inflammation, and lung cancer development. Identification of the role of CREB throughout the spectrum of normal epithelial differentiation, inflammation, and carcinogenesis in the lung is a unique aspect of my laboratory’s research program. In the future, I will continue to comprehensively investigate this new paradigm, which may lead to development of novel therapeutic methods for chronic lung inflammation and lung carcinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.     &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal Physiologic Differentiation of Bronchial Epithelial Cells &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physiologic function of bronchial epithelial cells present in the lung with inflammatory diseases, such as COPD, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer, is often compromised. Mechanisms by which normal mucociliary differentiated bronchial epithelium is maintained and by which aberrant differentiation of bronchial epithelium develops are not known (&lt;em&gt;Mol Biol Cell&lt;/em&gt; 2006; &lt;em&gt;Mol Cell Biol&lt;/em&gt; 2007). Understanding the differentiation mechanism of bronchial epithelial cells would provide important knowledge and novel targets for prevention and treatment of lung diseases.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We showed that CREB has a novel role in airway epithelial cells under both physiologic and pathobiologic conditions. Specifically,under physiologic conditions,CREB plays a critical role in the expression of the &lt;em&gt;MUC5AC&lt;/em&gt; mucous cell-specific marker gene and in normal differentiation of airway epithelial cells. Under pathobiologic conditions, persistent activation of CREB by inflammatory mediators such as the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1b and prostaglandins plays a critical role in the overexpression of &lt;em&gt;MUC5AC, &lt;/em&gt;mucous cell metaplasia, and resulting mucus hypersecretion (&lt;em&gt;J Immunol&lt;/em&gt; 2009). Further studies showed that the PKC/MEK/ERK/p90RSK/CREB pathway is the major signaling cascade in which these stimuli activate CREB. On the other hand, squamous metaplasia in the bronchial epithelium lacks expression of CREB. Thus, it is apparent that CREB is playing dual roles in physiology and pathobiology in the lung. In addition, altered expression and activation of molecules in the signaling pathway have been implicated in carcinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the precise mechanism by which the CREB signaling pathway system regulates normal differentiation mechanisms of bronchial epithelial cells. Abnormally differentiated bronchial epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of several lung diseases, including COPD, asthma, emphysema, and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.  Targeting Transcription Factors: CREB as a Novel Target for Cancer Treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are focusing on to identify methods and novel drugs to target CREB transcription system for preventive and/or therapeutic strategies in patients with NSCLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation and Cancer: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting Signal Transduction Networks from Chemokine Receptor to Transcription Factors (CREB and NF-kB) for Cancer Prevention and Treatment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CXCR2 expression in NSCLC tumor cells is frequent and associated with an adverse outcome. The receptor system is associated with an activation of the KRAS and NF-kB pathways.  We are developing new methods and drugs targeting this chemokine system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.     &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal Physiologic Differentiation of Bronchial Epithelial Cells &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study is to elucidate the precise mechanism of normal differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells. Abnormally differentiated bronchial epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of several lung diseases, including COPD, asthma, emphysema, and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

First, identification of relevant miRNA targets, especially cell-specific target transcripts &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 10pt; &quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;,can be difficult. Second, genetic manipulation (i.e. targeted knockout) of miRNA sequences in the vertebrate genome can be challenging and, until recently, had been limited to mice.

Both strategies are based on engineering specific chimeric DNA binding proteins,fused to the nuclease domain of the restriction enzyme Fok1 . Upon binding and dimerization they cleave DNA creating a double strand break repaired by non-homologous end joining, often resulting in a micro-deletion or insertion in the genome sequence.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;I am interested in collaborative capacity-building efforts for surgery and perioperative care in resource-poor settings. Specifically, I have been part of efforts to improve surgery and peri-operative care in Uganda over the last ten years, primarily through the group Global Partners in Anesthesia and Surgery (www.globalpas.org). We have focused on education and training as well as research on the burden of surgical disease, the neglect of the global surgical workforce, epidemiology and access to surgical care in resource-poor countries, and global health disparities, across a wide range of surgical specialties. Specific areas have included trauma training and trauma care, measurement of injury mortality and disparities, and pediatric surgery. I have also been working with international colleagues to advocate for the role of surgery within global health, through individual partnerships, academic and non-governmental organizations, and professional societies. We are especially interested in the public health aspects of surgical conditions in these settings. I also am interested in surgical education, and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

We have focused on education and training as well as research on the burden of surgical disease, the neglect of the global surgical workforce, epidemiology and access to surgical care in resource-poor countries, and global health disparities, across a wide range of surgical specialties. Specific areas have included trauma training and trauma care, measurement of injury mortality and disparities, and pediatric surgery. I have also been working with international colleagues to advocate for the role of surgery within global health, through individual partnerships, academic and non-governmental organizations, and professional societies. We are especially interested in the public health aspects of surgical conditions in these settings. I also am interested in surgical education, and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;p&gt;Capacity Building in Surgery and Perioperative Care in Uganda&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My research is focused mostly on identification and validation of cancer-associated genes to develop targeted therapies for head and neck cancers.  I started my career in the USA with the introduction of a high-throughput RNA Differential Display (RDD) screening technology into the field of VHL-deficient kidney cancer. This technology helped me link activation of cell surface carbonic anhydrases CA9 and CA12 with VHL mutations and hypoxia in cancer. Since then, CA9 has become a common marker and therapeutic target for renal clear cell carcinoma. While working at NYU as an Assistant Professor, I used expression and DNA array analyses to build a catalog of critical chromosomal deletions and amplifications typical for malignant mesothelioma. I then focused on the homozygous 9p21.3 deletion as a principal event in this disease associated with poor prognosis that leads to co-deletion of the CDKN2A area with miR-31, a novel tumor suppressor and potential therapeutic for malignant mesothelioma that I characterized.  At Vanderbilt University School of Medicine I performed the first comparative microarray profiling of clinical specimens of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and squamous head and neck carcinoma to identify genes and pathways involved in the propensity of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma to invade and grow along nerves. Based on the discovery of autocrine TrkC/NT-3 signaling, a pre-clinical study on a subcutaneous mouse model of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma was performed that showed efficacy of AZD7451, a potent Trk inhibitor developed by AstraZeneca.   &lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are very common in sexually active people in the United States and many other countries. High risk or oncogenic HPVs (such as HPV16) cause essentially all cervical cancer and are linked to many other types of cancers. The insufficient protections to all oncogenic HPV types and the high cost of the commercial available HPV vaccines encouraged scientists to recognize novel targets for anti-viral compounds and vaccine development. The DiMaio laboratory conducted a genome-wide siRNA screen of cellular factors required for HPV16 infection in epithelial cells and identified a number of human host factors crucial for infection, including the subunits of gamma-secretase (g-sec), a proteolytic enzyme that cleaves single pass membrane-bound proteins in their transmembrane domain. Previous studies reported that inhibition of g-sec blocks HPV infection, suggesting the crucial role of g-sec in HPV entry pathway and the potential use of g-sec as a target to prevent the spread of this oncogenic virus. However, neither the molecular mechanism of g-sec mediated HPV infection nor information regarding the role of g-sec substrates in this process has been elucidated. We hypothesize that the proper processing of substrate(s) by g-sec is essential for intracellular transport of HPV16 into cellular compartments for successful infection. Therefore, we will perform the following experiments to unveil the role of g-sec and its substrate(s) in HPV16 entry, which will reveal viral strategies to enter host cells by analyzing virus-cell interactions and uptake mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;The central mission of my research program is to 1. Improve our understanding of blood brain barrier injury, inflammation, and swelling after acute central nervous system injury and 2. Translate novel therapies to critically ill neurological patients in the hopes of improving what are all too often devastating outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the early part of my career, I have partnered with Marc Simard, a vascular neurosurgeon at the University of Maryland, who discovered a new receptor in the brain, SUR1, expressed on all components of the neurovascular unit. Blockade at the capillary level reduces the formation of the space-occupying edema responsible for cell death. Small molecule-based therapy using the well-known and safe drug glyburide is effective in blocking this channel, thereby significantly reducing edema formation following ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the direct purpose of translating this therapy using a novel approach in stroke (prevention of swelling), I have formed a research group working toward solving fundamental gaps in knowledge with the ability to reliably measure brain edema. In order to develop this intermediate endpoint, we have recently validated and published unique neuroimaging measures of brain swelling in patients with large stroke. These imaging endpoints now serve as a primary efficacy endpoint in our phase II NINDS submission. In addition, we are exploring how novel therapies like glyburide may attenuate serum markers of injury at the blood-brain barrier. Early work in human patients suggests that MMP-9 levels are reduced in patients treated with glyburide, and this observation is associated with decreased swelling and hemorrhagic transformation. We continue to search for new pharmacodynamics markers of injury. Both areas of inquiry leverage existing collaborations with groups at Massachusetts General Hospital, Stanford University, and other institutions as well as newly developed groups here at Yale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUR1 appears to be implicated broadly after CNS injury, and we are now pursuing new directions with my transition to Yale. One new area of inquiry is a potential collaboration with the Yale PET center to develop a carbon labeled version of glyburide so that we may use the drug as a marker of blood brain barrier integrity and injury, both in terms of spatial and temporal resolution of injury. Another new collaboration has formed with Laura Ment in pediatric neurology to explore the role of SUR1 in blood brain barrier breakdown and hemorrhage in the setting of germinal matrix hemorrhage in preterm infants. These projects are under way and serve as the basis for new grant applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of clinical translation, I have had the privilege of leading several phase II studies testing glyburide in ischemic stroke patients at high risk for brain swelling. Initial pilot studies have been completed, submitted for publication and highlighted at the NIH Princeton Stroke Conference and the International Stroke Conference, receiving top awards at both meetings. This work has been internationally recognized in the stroke community as an example of translating an exciting basic science discovery (SUR1) to patients, using a novel target (brain swelling) that has required innovation along the way (imaging and serum biomarkers of inflammation and swelling). I now co-lead one 12 center phase II study (GAMES-RP) in the next stage of this program as well as a complementary phase II study (GAMES) which has submitted to NIH. Both studies involve academic-industry partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, because outcome assessment is a critical component of successful patient-centered translation, a significant aspect of our program, in patients with intracranial hemorrhage, has focused on prognosis and aggressiveness of care. I currently lead a 4-center prospective observational study where we obtain prognosis predictions from nurses and physicians within 24 hours of hospital admission. These individual estimates are compared against proposed prognosis scores such as the ICH Score. This work builds on prior studies where I examined the association of various interventions in ICH, aggressiveness of care, anti-epileptic drug use, and outcome. Preliminary data from this work is now being used to help support career development awards for junior faculty in this section who have specific interests in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My independent research program has been supported by multiple early career development awards, and now serves as the basis for submitted NIH and other applications. The focus on translation of preclinical science to patients as well as patient centered outcomes directly supports a primary mission of the Neurology Department and Yale Medical School, to further the clinical research enterprise. Recognition of this work is evidenced by several invited reviews in malignant edema and leadership roles in multiple international writing groups for the management of brain swelling and palliative care. I am a member of the steering committee of the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) Clinical Trial Network, have served as the scientific meeting co-chair for NCS, and sit on several editorial boards for leading journals in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do cells measure length and time? How do they count? How do they sense their shapet? These are some of the most important outstanding questions in cell and developmental biology. For example, how do proliferating cells know how big they are and when to stop growing and to start dividing? How do organs, such as brain and liver, ensure that they manufacture enough cells, but not too many? How do cells control the dimensions of their organelles, such as endosomes, cilia and mitotic spindles? How do cells make certain that they have exactly two copies of each chromosome, that they have just one cilium, but that dividing cells have exactly two mitotic-spindle poles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are difficult questions because they address “systems-level” processes whose length-scales and time-scales differ strikingly from those of the constituent molecules—the proteins, lipids and nucleic acids—that form the molecular building blocks of cells. The goal of our research is to find molecule-level answers to these systems-level questions. Just as a radio or a computer must be understood in terms of their constituent analog or digital circuits, cell and tissue morphology must be understood in terms of underlying molecular circuits. These circuits comprise networks of interacting molecules. What kinds of computations can they perform? How do they assemble? What feedback-control mechanisms operate to control the size, shape and organization of molecular assemblies? Reaction-diffusion equations have dominated our thinking about biological patterning since the seminar work of Turing in the 1950s; however, we argue that active, mechanical processes mediated by motor proteins and the cytoskeleton, may play an even more important role in morphogenesis than purely chemical mechanisms (Howard et al. 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research is focused on the mechanics of the cytoskeleton, an internal filamentous scaffold that provides structure to the cell by supporting the plasma membrane and anchoring the organelles. The cytoskeleton serves as a network of tracks along which motor proteins transport subcellular structures. The research is concentrated on the mechanics of the cytoskeleton (Howard, Mechanics of Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton, Sinauer and Associates, Sunderland MA, 2001), with a particular emphasis on microtubules and microtubule-based motor proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we are interested in how these proteins work as nanomachines. How do motors and other microtubule-binding proteins couple an energy source, the hydrolysis of ATP or GTP, into mechanical work used to regulate the assembly and disassembly of the cytoskeleton? On the other hand, we are interested in how microtubules and their motors move and shape organelles and cells. For example, how do the dynamic properties of microtubules drive the assembly of the mitotic spindle and control its size and shape? And how does dynein drive the beating of the axoneme, leading to the serpentine motion of sperm and cilia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach is to combine measurement and theory. The challenge is that the complexity of biological systems makes quantitative measurements and their interpretation exceedingly difficult. The key to circumventing these difficulties is the use of single-molecule techniques, in whose development our lab played an important role (e.g. Howard et al. 1989). Using single-molecule optical techniques, the interactions between the individual motor and cytoskeletal molecules can be characterized in vitro and in vivo.

										<li>										&lt;p&gt;Motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do cells measure length and time? How do they count? How do they sense their shapet? These are some of the most important outstanding questions in cell and developmental biology. For example, how do proliferating cells know how big they are and when to stop growing and to start dividing? How do organs, such as brain and liver, ensure that they manufacture enough cells, but not too many? How do cells control the dimensions of their organelles, such as endosomes, cilia and mitotic spindles? How do cells make certain that they have exactly two copies of each chromosome, that they have just one cilium, but that dividing cells have exactly two mitotic-spindle poles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are difficult questions because they address “systems-level” processes whose length-scales and time-scales differ strikingly from those of the constituent molecules—the proteins, lipids and nucleic acids—that form the molecular building blocks of cells. The goal of our research is to find molecule-level answers to these systems-level questions. Just as a radio or a computer must be understood in terms of their constituent analog or digital circuits, cell and tissue morphology must be understood in terms of underlying molecular circuits. These circuits comprise networks of interacting molecules. What kinds of computations can they perform? How do they assemble? What feedback-control mechanisms operate to control the size, shape and organization of molecular assemblies? Reaction-diffusion equations have dominated our thinking about biological patterning since the seminar work of Turing in the 1950s; however, we argue that active, mechanical processes mediated by motor proteins and the cytoskeleton, may play an even more important role in morphogenesis than purely chemical mechanisms (Howard et al. 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research is focused on the mechanics of the cytoskeleton, an internal filamentous scaffold that provides structure to the cell by supporting the plasma membrane and anchoring the organelles. The cytoskeleton serves as a network of tracks along which motor proteins transport subcellular structures. The research is concentrated on the mechanics of the cytoskeleton (Howard, Mechanics of Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton, Sinauer and Associates, Sunderland MA, 2001), with a particular emphasis on microtubules and microtubule-based motor proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we are interested in how these proteins work as nanomachines. How do motors and other microtubule-binding proteins couple an energy source, the hydrolysis of ATP or GTP, into mechanical work used to regulate the assembly and disassembly of the cytoskeleton? On the other hand, we are interested in how microtubules and their motors move and shape organelles and cells. For example, how do the dynamic properties of microtubules drive the assembly of the mitotic spindle and control its size and shape? And how does dynein drive the beating of the axoneme, leading to the serpentine motion of sperm and cilia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach is to combine measurement and theory. The challenge is that the complexity of biological systems makes quantitative measurements and their interpretation exceedingly difficult. The key to circumventing these difficulties is the use of single-molecule techniques, in whose development our lab played an important role (e.g. Howard et al. 1989). Using single-molecule optical techniques, the interactions between the individual motor and cytoskeletal molecules can be characterized in vitro and in vivo. These interactions constitute a form of mechanical signaling (Howard 2009). We then use theory, primarily from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics, to predict how the individual interactions lead to the collective behavior of ensembles of molecules. We then test these predictions with quantitative in vivo experiments on intact cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;<ins class='diffins'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microtubule dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microtubules are biological polymers that alternate between periods of growth and shrinkage. This process, termed dynamic instability by its discovers Mitchison and Kirshner, is crucial for microtubule length regulation, for the exploration of intracellular space, and for cellular force generation. Despite its central role in cell biology, dynamic instability is poorly understood. For example, the GTP-cap, which is thought to regulate catastrophe, the transition from growth to shrinkage, has never been visualized on dynamic microtubules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are advancing the field by bringing three new approaches to the problem. First, we have developed assays to study microtubule dynamics using single-molecule techniques: total-internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (Brouhard et al. 2008, and see right for motors moving along a microtubule) and optical tweezers (Bormuth et al. 2009, Jannasch et al. 2013, Trushko et al. 2013). Second, we have used these assays to figure out how microtubule-associated proteins regulate microtubule dynamics. We have shown how depolymerizing kinesins target microtubule ends and couple ATP hydrolysis to microtubule shortening (Helenius et al. 2006, Varga et a. 2006, 2009, Friel and Howard 2011); we discovered that XMAP215 is a processive polymerase (Brouhard et al. 2008, Widlund et al. 2011); and we found that the end-binding protein EB1 recognizes the nucleotide state of tubulin (Zanic et al. 2009) to increase catastrophe and to synergize with XMAP215 to increase microtubule growth rates (Zanic et al. 2013). The third approach is to use theory to gain insight into microtubule length control (Varga et al. 2009), the catastrophe switch (Gardner et al. 2011, Bowne-Anderson et al. 2013) and the collective properties of motor proteins (Leduc et al. 2012).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The motility of cilia and flagella&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the motor protein dynein drives microtubule sliding and bending in cilia and flagella has been known since the classic experiments of Gibbons, Brokaw and Satir in the 1960s and 1970s. However, how the key question of how the activity of the dyneins is coordinated to give a periodic beat remains an open. We are bringing a new constellation of techniques to the problem. In earlier work, we hypothesized that the dyneins are coordinated through a force-sensing mechanism: sliding forces provide positive feedback that switches the activity of the motors across the axis of the axoneme (the motile structure within cilia and flagella) and couples the motors along the length of the axoneme (Riedel-Kruse et al. 2007, Howard 2009). Using high-speed imaging and high-precision image analysis, we showed that our hypothesis can account very satisfactorily for the beat of mammalian sperm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now using the single-celled alga Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii as a model system to study (i) the beating of isolated, reactivated axonemes, and (ii) the activity of individual dynein molecules purified from these axonemes. In this way we hope to obtain a molecular understanding of one of the most elegant and enigmatic examples of cell locomotion. Oscillators are a paradigms of emergence because the system behavior obscures the contributions of the individual players. We hope to the obtain the first truly molecular and biochemical understanding of a cellular oscillator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on several other projects in which the dynamic and structural properties of microtubules underly important cellular processes such as mitosis (Grill et al. 2003, Pecreaux et al. 2006, Redemann et al. 2010, Reber et al. 2013), mechanotransduction (Howard and Bechstedt et al. 2004, Bechstedt et al. 2010, Liang et al. 2013) and neuronal morphology.&lt;/p&gt;</ins>

										<li>&lt;p&gt;A clinically active gastroenterologist, my research and clinical interests relate to colorectal cancer. I have been conducting basic and translational research for over 15 years, first in Spain and over the last 7 years in the USA, first in Chicago and since March 2014 at Yale University. While in Spain I was responsible for the development and implementation of two large prospective cohorts of CRC patients, Epicolon I and II. These studies included the systematic enrollment of over 2,000 newly diagnosed CRC and 1,000 controls in 25 hospitals all over Spain. Epicolon I collected complete clinical and pedigree data, with a 5 year follow up, as well as tumor DNA and non-involved colonic tissue. Epicolon II also included germline DNA, as well as tumor RNA and proteins. Studies with these two cohorts have resulted in over 25 peer-reviewed publications. Along with Dr. Nathan Ellis we recently completed an ambitious study in Chicago, the Chicago Colorectal Cancer Consortium (CCCC). The study has a retrospective and a prospective component. The CCCC enrolled newly diagnosed CRC patients and controls from five large hospitals in the Chicago area: University of Illinois at Chicago, Jesse Brown Veterans Hospital, Rush University Medical Center, Stroger Hospital of Cook County, and University of Chicago. A robust and unified database and tissue repository system were established. Extensive demographic, clinical data, family history, nutritional data, toxics exposure were collected along with germline DNA, serum and plasma, tumor and non-involved tissue for DNA, RNA and protein extraction. A wealth of findings is resulting in the publication and preparation of several manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our description of the incidence and clinical features of mismatch repair proficient hereditary CRC families (MSS-HNPCC) in a population based cohort, my group has continued working on the study of the carcinogenic processes involved in these cancers, as well as the genetic basis underlying CRC in these families. Some novel and exciting findings are currently under review in peer reviewed journals&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;My research began in traditional computer science systems. This included architecture development for processing elements as well as Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) reconfigurable networks for multimedia and smart home environments. These FPGAs allow for the design and prototype of reconfigurable hardware systems ideal for signal processing. From this I moved into the embedded systems realm, applying my electrical engineering hardware background with my computer science math and algorithms background to develop full working systems. These embedded systems are application oriented, where each end product/goal introduces new challenges to the hardware platforms needed as well as the software algorithms that run on those platforms or the data produced by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of small, wearable sensors, it became possible to apply reserach in sensor networks to the human through the use of Body Sensor Networks (BSN). These BSN allow for the development of human-oriented embedded systems, with a wide range of possible applications, many of which span the realm of health care. My Ph.D. focussed on such a system for physical activity monitoring. By placing multiple inertial measurement units (IMUs - sensors containing accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers) on various parts of the body, it becomes very simple to collect lots of time-series data on human motion. However, determining more detailed specifics of such motion are often more complicated. Many traditional human activity goals look at either developing a simple pedometer application or identifying common cyclical patterns (such as walking, climbing stairs, etc.). These patterns use common supervised learning techniques to identify a type of motion over a period of time. What if, however, you wanted to know detailed movements, such as those in sports, and as they were happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research in physical activity monitoring aimed at focusing on such a question. In particular, could you monitor sports motinos, where the actions are often singular intense actions with little to no repetition, and apply such a recognition system to be the input to a new video gaming system? If so, you could develop an exercise-based game (called exergaming) that would allow for users to play games with increased energy expenditure. I looked at all the challenges in developing such a system, applied to a soccer gaming environment, from the sensor design for ubiquitous monitoring, to the machine learning algorithm at the core of the work. I analyzed the feature extraction and classificaiton techniques necessary to make the recognition of fine-grain activities possible. Furhter, I investigated the trade-offs necessary in a gaming environment, which include possibly sacrificing accuracy in an attempt to arrive at a classification in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of such algorithms and systems can, however, be extended beyond the exergaming environment. My research goals at Yale include applying such supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to medical data in an attempt to develop better risk models for hospital re-admissions, with an eye toward cardiology and heart failure. Such data analytic techniques may be able to identify patterns for risk models not known through common biostatistic methods.&lt;/p&gt;
