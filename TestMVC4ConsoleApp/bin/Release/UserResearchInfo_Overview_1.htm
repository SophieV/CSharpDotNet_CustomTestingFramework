<p><br />Recent studies of a spontaneous mutation arising in a substrain of FVB mice that results in a striking deficiency in the skin of the prototypic Vg5/Vd1+ DETCs seen in other normal mice strains led to further studies that proved that this heritable defect in a dominant gene resided in fetal thymic epithelial cells resulting in a failure of positive selection in the thymus (and subsequent migration to the skin) of the Vg5/Vd1+ fetal thymic precursors. (These results, published in Nature Immunology, present the first definitive proof that d cells resident in epithelial interfaces with the external environment, like conventional recirculating a&szlig; T cells, undergo positive selection in the thymus.) In a productive collaborative followup study between Drs. Tigelaar, Girardi and Hayday with Richard Lifton (Genetics) recently published in Nature Genetics, it was shown that this defect is caused by mutation in Skint1, a newly identified gene expressed in thymus and skin that encodes a protein with immunoglobulin-like and transmembrane domains. Skint1 is the prototypic member of a rapidly evolving family of at least 11 genes in mouse, with greatest similarity to the butyrophilin genes. These findings define a new family of proteins mediating key epithelial-immune interactions.</p><ins class='diffins'>Current collaborative studies with Dr. Adrian Hayday (Guy's Hospital, London) include:

</ins><li><ins class='diffins'>Characterizing the genes expressed by "resting" and "activated" DETC by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and comparing such expression patterns with other IEL and recirculating T cell subsets.</ins></li><ins class='diffins'>

We have also reported CD47 as the ligand for MFR, and CD44 as a molecule highly but transiently expressed at the onset of fusion. Most recently, we showed that CD200 is highly expressed in osteoclasts, but only at the onset of fusion of macrophages, which do not express CD200. Our goal is to define the role of these molecules in the fusion of macrophages. We have used genome-wide cDNA microarrays to identify the genes that belong to the fusion machinery.

By targeting the expression of the CGRP gene to beta cells of the endocrine pancreas of NOD mice, which develop spontaneous diabetes, we have shown that CGRP prevents type I diabetes. This indicates that CGRP acts as a local immunoregulatory peptide. Our goal is to investigate how CGRP controls immune cells function and whether CGRP can be targeted in vivo, using genetic engineering or local delivery, so as to allow for the survival of transplanted organs, and treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.</li>

<span style='color:red;']</span>[p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;"]</span>I am primarily interested in host-pathogen interaction, with a focus on RNA viruses <span style='color:red;']</span>[em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"]</span>in vivo<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"]</span>in vitro<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>. Specifically, I wish to understand pathogenic mechanisms of viral infection at the cellular and animal levels, and study the molecular function of host genes that influence viral pathogenesis and the disease outcomes. On the host side, I am keen on the innate immune system, detection of viruses and initiation of antiviral immune response.  On the virus side, I wish to understand the mechanisms of immune evasion. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;"]</span>The <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>Flaviviridae<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> family consists of a large number of ssRNA viruses that cause fatal human diseases.  For example, West Nile virus (WNV) is the culprit of thousands of encephalitis/meningitis cases and deaths since 1999. Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with a mortality of 1&ndash;5% if untreated. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects ~3% of the world's population and causes 350,000 deaths yearly.  I attempt to identify novel host factors that restrict or facilitate virus pathogenesis <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>in vivo<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>in vitro<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>. These factors may be regulators of host antiviral immune pathways or participants of viral life cycle including surface receptors mediating viral entry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these disease conditions and virus specific host immune response can advance the development of specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>]</span>.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;"]</span>I am primarily interested in host-pathogen interaction, with a focus on RNA viruses <span style='color:red;']</span>[em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"]</span>in vivo<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"]</span>in vitro<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>. Specifically, I wish to understand pathogenic mechanisms of viral infection at the cellular and animal levels, and study the molecular function of host genes that influence viral pathogenesis and the disease outcomes. On the host side, I am keen on the innate immune system, detection of viruses and initiation of antiviral immune response.  On the virus side, I wish to understand the mechanisms of immune evasion. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;"]</span>The <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>Flaviviridae<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> family consists of a large number of ssRNA viruses that cause fatal human diseases.  For example, West Nile virus (WNV) is the culprit of thousands of encephalitis/meningitis cases and deaths since 1999. Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with a mortality of 1&ndash;5% if untreated. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects ~3% of the world's population and causes 350,000 deaths yearly.  I attempt to identify novel host factors that restrict or facilitate virus pathogenesis <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>in vivo<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>in vitro<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>. These factors may be regulators of host antiviral immune pathways or participants of viral life cycle including surface receptors mediating viral entry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these disease conditions and virus specific host immune response can advance the development of specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>1.

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;">I am primarily interested in host-pathogen interaction, with a focus on RNA viruses <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in vivo</em> and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in vitro</em>. Specifically, I wish to understand pathogenic mechanisms of viral infection at the cellular and animal levels, and study the molecular function of host genes that influence viral pathogenesis and the disease outcomes. On the host side, I am keen on the innate immune system, detection of viruses and initiation of antiviral immune response.  On the virus side, I wish to understand the mechanisms of immune evasion. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;">The <em>Flaviviridae</em> family consists of a large number of ssRNA viruses that cause fatal human diseases.  For example, West Nile virus (WNV) is the culprit of thousands of encephalitis/meningitis cases and deaths since 1999. Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with a mortality of 1&ndash;5% if untreated. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects ~3% of the world's population and causes 350,000 deaths yearly.  I attempt to identify novel host factors that restrict or facilitate virus pathogenesis <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em>. These factors may be regulators of host antiviral immune pathways or participants of viral life cycle including surface receptors mediating viral entry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these disease conditions and virus specific host immune response can advance the development of specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;">I am primarily interested in host-pathogen interaction, with a focus on RNA viruses <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in vivo</em> and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in vitro</em>. Specifically, I wish to understand pathogenic mechanisms of viral infection at the cellular and animal levels, and study the molecular function of host genes that influence viral pathogenesis and the disease outcomes. On the host side, I am keen on the innate immune system, detection of viruses and initiation of antiviral immune response.  On the virus side, I wish to understand the mechanisms of immune evasion. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;">The <em>Flaviviridae</em> family consists of a large number of ssRNA viruses that cause fatal human diseases.  For example, West Nile virus (WNV) is the culprit of thousands of encephalitis/meningitis cases and deaths since 1999. Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with a mortality of 1&ndash;5% if untreated. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects ~3% of the world's population and causes 350,000 deaths yearly.  I attempt to identify novel host factors that restrict or facilitate virus pathogenesis <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em>. These factors may be regulators of host antiviral immune pathways or participants of viral life cycle including surface receptors mediating viral entry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these disease conditions and virus specific host immune response can advance the development of specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.</p><p><ins class='diffins'>1.

Regulated folding and assembly of SNARE proteins involved in membrane fusion.  SNARE proteins are the engines for membrane fusion.  The current model for SNARE function suggests that these proteins generate forces to drive the fusion through an unusual protein zippering mechanism, by which a pair of cognate SNARE proteins (t- and v-SNAREs) progressively fold and assemble to form an extraordinarily stable four-helix bundle. This assembly process is controlled by numerous proteins that regulate the fusion in a spatially- and temporally-specific manner.  We have undertaken to measure the force produced by a single pair of SNAREs and characterize how the force production is regulated by key regulatory proteins involved in synaptic transmission.   </ins><br><br><blockquote><ins class='diffins'>Jahn, R., and Scheller, R.H.

Membrane remodeling or fission mediated by dynamin and BAR proteins. Dynamin has long been considered as a mechanochemical enzyme essential for endocytosis including neuronal endocytosis.

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>We are interested in the molecular and cellular mechanisms that
govern the behavior of stem cells, in particular how they balance the
needs of self-renewal and differentiation during mammalian
organogenesis and tissue maintenance. Current research uses
neurogenesis in mice as a model system to study how neural stem
(progenitor) cells are maintained and how neuronal diversity is
generated in the mammalian nervous system. We are examining whether
Numb-mediated asymmetric cell division represents a mechanism that is
shared by stem cells in many tissues for their progeny to choose
between self-renewal and differentiation. By elucidating how this
mechanism acts together with other cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic
cues to form organs and maintain tissue homeostasis, we hope to
understand the fundamental biology of stem cells and provide insights
for their therapeutic use in repairing or replacing damaged tissues. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
               <span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Stem
cells, whether of embryonic or adult origin, are defined by the ability
to produce more stem cells (self-renew) and the potential to generate
differentiated offspring for carrying out tissue function. For stem
cells involved in organogenesis and tissue maintenance, there is also
an essential need to ensure a proper balance between self-renewal and
differentiation, since a failure in either task will lead to organ
malformation and tissue malfunction. How this is accomplished at the
molecular and cellular level, however, remains poorly understood in
mammals. Conceptually, stem cells can simultaneously self-renew and
differentiate by dividing asymmetrically to produce one daughter cell
that remains as a stem cell and another that differentiates. Stem
cells, however, may also need to divide symmetrically to produce two
stem cells, which can quickly expand their population when responding
to a tissue injury, or to generate two differentiated cells, when large
numbers of stem cells are no longer necessary towards the end of
organogenesis and tissue repair. In other words, understanding the
division patterns of stem cells â€“ particularly how they are regulated
under normal and pathological conditions â€“ may facilitate a key goal of
stem-cell research, which is to repair or replace damaged tissues by
introducing exogenous stem cells or expanding endogenous populations. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
               <span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Asymmetric
cell division, a process by which a cell divides to produce two
different daughter cells, is widely used by invertebrates to generate
cellular diversity during development. In <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>Drosophila,<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> the
Numb protein enables the two daughter cells to adopt different fates
after such divisions by segregating primarily to one daughter cell. To
examine the importance of asymmetric cell division in mammalian
development, we identified two mouse <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>numb<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> genes, <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>m-numb (Numb)<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>numblike (Numbl <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>or<span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span> nbl)<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>.
We postulated that mammalian neural progenitor cells, which behave like
stem cells during neurogenesis, balance self-renewal and
differentiation by segregating Numb proteins asymmetrically to produce

an essential need to ensure a proper balance between self-renewal and

mammals. Conceptually, stem cells can simultaneously self-renew and
differentiate by dividing asymmetrically to produce one daughter cell

stem cells, which can quickly expand their population when responding
to a tissue injury, or to generate two differentiated cells, when large
numbers of stem cells are no longer necessary towards the end of
organogenesis and tissue repair. In other words, understanding the
division patterns of stem cells – particularly how they are regulated

<span style='color:red;']</span>[li]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Regulation of arterial development and branching morphogenesis<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>   The purpose of these studies is to elucidate molecular pathways leading to arterial specification of the endothelium and formation of arterial vasculature.  We have recently demonstrated that  knockout of synectin, a PDZ protein involved in endosomal trafficking of a number of TK receptor complexes leads to selective reduction in arterial morphogenesis and vascular branching (Chittenden et al Dev Cell, 2006). We have now demonstrated that synectin controls retrograde trafficking of VEGF-R2 containing endosomes via its binding to myosin-VI.  Interestingly, myosin-VI knockout in mice or knockdown in zebrafish leads to the same arteriopenic phenotype.  This abnormal receptor trafficking results in impaired activation of one of VEGF-R2 signaling pathways that appears to be crucial for arterial specification.   Rescue of this aspect of VEGF signaling fully restores arterial morphogenesis not only in synectin null or myosin-VI null mice but in other models of poor arterial development. Thus, this may be the critical pathways specifying arterial formation. Funding: NHLBI (2007-2012)   
<span style='color:red;']</span>[li]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Regulation of vascular maintenance<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>. It has not been realized until recently that maintenance of vascular integrity is an active process requiring an ongoing signaling. We have been able to demonstrate that suppression of basal FGF signaling in endothelial cells results in loss of cell-cell contacts and loss of endothelium from the vascular wall (Murakami et al. JCI 2008). The molecular events involved include FGF regulation of VE-cadherin phosphorylation and suppression of local Src activation. Current efforts are focused on characterization of the FGF signaling-VE-cadherin link and elucidation of other pathways regulating VE-cadherin maintenance t the plasma cell membrane Funding: NHLBI (2008-2013).

Over the years my lab has demonstrated that syndecan-4 plays a critical role in regulation of FGF signaling (Horowitz, JCB â€™02 and many others) and that this involves regulation of its trafficking to the plasma membrane rafts and endocytosis among other events (Tkachenko JBC â€™02, JCS â€™04, Circ Res â€™06). Recently we discovered that in addition to its role in FGF signaling syndecan-4 controls formation of mTOR complex 2 and activation of  the Akt pathway (Partovian et a l Mol Cell â€™08). Among many interesting phenotypes in syndecan-4 null is mice is arterial hypertension (lack of Akt activation leads to suppressed NO production) and defective tumor but not ischemic angiogenesis.  We are currently examining molecular events involved in syndecan-4 dependent regulation of mTORC2 formation that apparently include activation of RhoG via a novel mechanism involving sequestration of Rho-GDI (JCB, '09) Funding: NHLBI (2008-2013) <span style='color:red;']</span>[/li]</span>

<li><strong>Role of Raf1 and MAPK signaling in regulation of arterial specification:<em>  </em></strong>We find that PI3K has the ability to inhibit MAPK signaling by phosphorylating Raf1 and that activation of RAf1 leads to profound stimulation of arterial growth and arterial specification. The molecular details of this pathways are being examined in a variety of transgenic mice models   
<li>Activation of arteriogenesis in arteriogenesis-resistant states: abnormal VEGF and other angiogenic growth factor signaling may be at the core of many events associated with advanced atherosclerosis, diabetes and other angiogenic signaling-resistant states. We are testing the concept that activation of arteriogenic signaling downstream of VEGF-R2 may promore arteriogenesis and become an effective therapeutic approach. </li>

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Data show that
psychological factors play an important role in acute coronary syndromes. We
and others, have found mentally demanding tasks such as mental arithmetic to
provoke ischemia in approximately 50% of patients with ischemic heart disease.
We have also found a specific psychological profile, characterized by emotional
reactivity, and easily aroused anger and hostility, to be associated with this
â€œmental stress ischemiaâ€; conversely, we have not found an association between
this profile and exercise ischemia. Follow up of these mental stress positive
patients reveal a significantly poorer 1-2 year prognosis. Hence, mental stress
ischemia may be a distinct phenomenon with unique risk factors and prognosis.
The mechanisms of mental stress ischemia are, however, not well understood.
Critical questions remain regarding the ways by which mental and psychological
factors contribute to coronary syndromes. We believe that psychological,
neurobiological and coronary vasomotor processes are key factors, expanding
upon our pilot work, conducted in the context of our current funding. We are
examining the functional CNS correlates of mental stress ischemia; these CNS correlates
will be defined by positron emission tomography (PET) conducted while patients
perform an arithmetic task that we have found to reliably provoke ischemia in

The overarching research theme of
our research is the elucidation of those mechanisms, which transduce cognitive
stress as a provocation of myocardial ischemia. Specifically, we are interested
in the neurobiology and coronary flow dynamics that results from mentally
stressful tasks. Our work utilizes simultaneous
measurements of brain activation and myocardial function/coronary flow with
PET imaging, echocardiography and pulse arterial tonometry during laboratory
mental stress. We are developing conceptual constructs based upon our previous
work, which support a model that suggests certain regional and global brain
activation maps
are associated with coronary flow responses specific to psychosocial stress.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Our goal for the next academic year

surrogate for exercise in a population of
CAD subjects. Our results thus far support our hypothesis of regional
activation in the brain that promote parasympathetic withdrawal, increase
in sympathetic tone and decrease LV flow/ function that is not observed in the

year we have expanded our constructs regarding the role of other vascular
factors, which may be operative during Mental Stress Ischemia. Specifically
our recent data suggests an up regulation of ET-1 among CAD patients who are
subjected to a standardized Anger recall paradigm. We have also described these

predicts such increases in response to w withdrawal of parasympathetic tone, a
cardinal feature of Mental Stress Induced Myocardial Ischemia. We have observed
an inverse relationship of TNF-alpha and parasympathetic withdrawal in subjects
who become ischemic and have specific regional brain activation

psychological factors play an important role in acute coronary syndromes. We
and others, have found mentally demanding tasks such as mental arithmetic to
provoke ischemia in approximately 50% of patients with ischemic heart disease.
We have also found a specific psychological profile, characterized by emotional
reactivity, and easily aroused anger and hostility, to be associated with this
“mental stress ischemia”; conversely, we have not found an association between
this profile and exercise ischemia. Follow up of these mental stress positive
patients reveal a significantly poorer 1-2 year prognosis. Hence, mental stress
ischemia may be a distinct phenomenon with unique risk factors and prognosis.
The mechanisms of mental stress ischemia are, however, not well understood.
Critical questions remain regarding the ways by which mental and psychological
factors contribute to coronary syndromes. We believe that psychological,
neurobiological and coronary vasomotor processes are key factors, expanding
upon our pilot work, conducted in the context of our current funding. We are
examining the functional CNS correlates of mental stress ischemia; these CNS correlates
will be defined by positron emission tomography (PET) conducted while patients
perform an arithmetic task that we have found to reliably provoke ischemia in
