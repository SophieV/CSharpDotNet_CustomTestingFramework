<p><br />Recent studies of a spontaneous mutation arising in a substrain of FVB mice that results in a striking deficiency in the skin of the prototypic Vg5/Vd1+ DETCs seen in other normal mice strains led to further studies that proved that this heritable defect in a dominant gene resided in fetal thymic epithelial cells resulting in a failure of positive selection in the thymus (and subsequent migration to the skin) of the Vg5/Vd1+ fetal thymic precursors. (These results, published in Nature Immunology, present the first definitive proof that d cells resident in epithelial interfaces with the external environment, like conventional recirculating a&szlig; T cells, undergo positive selection in the thymus.) In a productive collaborative followup study between Drs. Tigelaar, Girardi and Hayday with Richard Lifton (Genetics) recently published in Nature Genetics, it was shown that this defect is caused by mutation in Skint1, a newly identified gene expressed in thymus and skin that encodes a protein with immunoglobulin-like and transmembrane domains. Skint1 is the prototypic member of a rapidly evolving family of at least 11 genes in mouse, with greatest similarity to the butyrophilin genes. These findings define a new family of proteins mediating key epithelial-immune interactions.</p><ins class='diffins'>Current collaborative studies with Dr. Adrian Hayday (Guy's Hospital, London) include:

</ins><li><ins class='diffins'>Characterizing the genes expressed by "resting" and "activated" DETC by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and comparing such expression patterns with other IEL and recirculating T cell subsets.</ins></li><ins class='diffins'>

We have also reported CD47 as the ligand for MFR, and CD44 as a molecule highly but transiently expressed at the onset of fusion. Most recently, we showed that CD200 is highly expressed in osteoclasts, but only at the onset of fusion of macrophages, which do not express CD200. Our goal is to define the role of these molecules in the fusion of macrophages. We have used genome-wide cDNA microarrays to identify the genes that belong to the fusion machinery.

By targeting the expression of the CGRP gene to beta cells of the endocrine pancreas of NOD mice, which develop spontaneous diabetes, we have shown that CGRP prevents type I diabetes. This indicates that CGRP acts as a local immunoregulatory peptide. Our goal is to investigate how CGRP controls immune cells function and whether CGRP can be targeted in vivo, using genetic engineering or local delivery, so as to allow for the survival of transplanted organs, and treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.</li>

<span style='color:red;']</span>[p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;"]</span>I am primarily interested in host-pathogen interaction, with a focus on RNA viruses <span style='color:red;']</span>[em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"]</span>in vivo<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"]</span>in vitro<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>. Specifically, I wish to understand pathogenic mechanisms of viral infection at the cellular and animal levels, and study the molecular function of host genes that influence viral pathogenesis and the disease outcomes. On the host side, I am keen on the innate immune system, detection of viruses and initiation of antiviral immune response.  On the virus side, I wish to understand the mechanisms of immune evasion. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;"]</span>The <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>Flaviviridae<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> family consists of a large number of ssRNA viruses that cause fatal human diseases.  For example, West Nile virus (WNV) is the culprit of thousands of encephalitis/meningitis cases and deaths since 1999. Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with a mortality of 1&ndash;5% if untreated. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects ~3% of the world's population and causes 350,000 deaths yearly.  I attempt to identify novel host factors that restrict or facilitate virus pathogenesis <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>in vivo<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>in vitro<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>. These factors may be regulators of host antiviral immune pathways or participants of viral life cycle including surface receptors mediating viral entry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these disease conditions and virus specific host immune response can advance the development of specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>]</span>.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;"]</span>I am primarily interested in host-pathogen interaction, with a focus on RNA viruses <span style='color:red;']</span>[em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"]</span>in vivo<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"]</span>in vitro<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>. Specifically, I wish to understand pathogenic mechanisms of viral infection at the cellular and animal levels, and study the molecular function of host genes that influence viral pathogenesis and the disease outcomes. On the host side, I am keen on the innate immune system, detection of viruses and initiation of antiviral immune response.  On the virus side, I wish to understand the mechanisms of immune evasion. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;"]</span>The <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>Flaviviridae<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> family consists of a large number of ssRNA viruses that cause fatal human diseases.  For example, West Nile virus (WNV) is the culprit of thousands of encephalitis/meningitis cases and deaths since 1999. Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with a mortality of 1&ndash;5% if untreated. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects ~3% of the world's population and causes 350,000 deaths yearly.  I attempt to identify novel host factors that restrict or facilitate virus pathogenesis <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>in vivo<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>in vitro<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>. These factors may be regulators of host antiviral immune pathways or participants of viral life cycle including surface receptors mediating viral entry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these disease conditions and virus specific host immune response can advance the development of specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>1.

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;">I am primarily interested in host-pathogen interaction, with a focus on RNA viruses <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in vivo</em> and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in vitro</em>. Specifically, I wish to understand pathogenic mechanisms of viral infection at the cellular and animal levels, and study the molecular function of host genes that influence viral pathogenesis and the disease outcomes. On the host side, I am keen on the innate immune system, detection of viruses and initiation of antiviral immune response.  On the virus side, I wish to understand the mechanisms of immune evasion. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;">The <em>Flaviviridae</em> family consists of a large number of ssRNA viruses that cause fatal human diseases.  For example, West Nile virus (WNV) is the culprit of thousands of encephalitis/meningitis cases and deaths since 1999. Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with a mortality of 1&ndash;5% if untreated. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects ~3% of the world's population and causes 350,000 deaths yearly.  I attempt to identify novel host factors that restrict or facilitate virus pathogenesis <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em>. These factors may be regulators of host antiviral immune pathways or participants of viral life cycle including surface receptors mediating viral entry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these disease conditions and virus specific host immune response can advance the development of specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;">I am primarily interested in host-pathogen interaction, with a focus on RNA viruses <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in vivo</em> and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in vitro</em>. Specifically, I wish to understand pathogenic mechanisms of viral infection at the cellular and animal levels, and study the molecular function of host genes that influence viral pathogenesis and the disease outcomes. On the host side, I am keen on the innate immune system, detection of viruses and initiation of antiviral immune response.  On the virus side, I wish to understand the mechanisms of immune evasion. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops: .5in;">The <em>Flaviviridae</em> family consists of a large number of ssRNA viruses that cause fatal human diseases.  For example, West Nile virus (WNV) is the culprit of thousands of encephalitis/meningitis cases and deaths since 1999. Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with a mortality of 1&ndash;5% if untreated. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects ~3% of the world's population and causes 350,000 deaths yearly.  I attempt to identify novel host factors that restrict or facilitate virus pathogenesis <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em>. These factors may be regulators of host antiviral immune pathways or participants of viral life cycle including surface receptors mediating viral entry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these disease conditions and virus specific host immune response can advance the development of specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.</p><p><ins class='diffins'>1.

Regulated folding and assembly of SNARE proteins involved in membrane fusion.  SNARE proteins are the engines for membrane fusion.  The current model for SNARE function suggests that these proteins generate forces to drive the fusion through an unusual protein zippering mechanism, by which a pair of cognate SNARE proteins (t- and v-SNAREs) progressively fold and assemble to form an extraordinarily stable four-helix bundle. This assembly process is controlled by numerous proteins that regulate the fusion in a spatially- and temporally-specific manner.  We have undertaken to measure the force produced by a single pair of SNAREs and characterize how the force production is regulated by key regulatory proteins involved in synaptic transmission.   </ins><br><br><blockquote><ins class='diffins'>Jahn, R., and Scheller, R.H.

Membrane remodeling or fission mediated by dynamin and BAR proteins. Dynamin has long been considered as a mechanochemical enzyme essential for endocytosis including neuronal endocytosis.

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>We are interested in the molecular and cellular mechanisms that
govern the behavior of stem cells, in particular how they balance the
needs of self-renewal and differentiation during mammalian
organogenesis and tissue maintenance. Current research uses
neurogenesis in mice as a model system to study how neural stem
(progenitor) cells are maintained and how neuronal diversity is
generated in the mammalian nervous system. We are examining whether
Numb-mediated asymmetric cell division represents a mechanism that is
shared by stem cells in many tissues for their progeny to choose
between self-renewal and differentiation. By elucidating how this
mechanism acts together with other cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic
cues to form organs and maintain tissue homeostasis, we hope to
understand the fundamental biology of stem cells and provide insights
for their therapeutic use in repairing or replacing damaged tissues. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
               <span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Stem
cells, whether of embryonic or adult origin, are defined by the ability
to produce more stem cells (self-renew) and the potential to generate
differentiated offspring for carrying out tissue function. For stem
cells involved in organogenesis and tissue maintenance, there is also
an essential need to ensure a proper balance between self-renewal and
differentiation, since a failure in either task will lead to organ
malformation and tissue malfunction. How this is accomplished at the
molecular and cellular level, however, remains poorly understood in
mammals. Conceptually, stem cells can simultaneously self-renew and
differentiate by dividing asymmetrically to produce one daughter cell
that remains as a stem cell and another that differentiates. Stem
cells, however, may also need to divide symmetrically to produce two
stem cells, which can quickly expand their population when responding
to a tissue injury, or to generate two differentiated cells, when large
numbers of stem cells are no longer necessary towards the end of
organogenesis and tissue repair. In other words, understanding the
division patterns of stem cells â€“ particularly how they are regulated
under normal and pathological conditions â€“ may facilitate a key goal of
stem-cell research, which is to repair or replace damaged tissues by
introducing exogenous stem cells or expanding endogenous populations. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
               <span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Asymmetric
cell division, a process by which a cell divides to produce two
different daughter cells, is widely used by invertebrates to generate
cellular diversity during development. In <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>Drosophila,<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> the
Numb protein enables the two daughter cells to adopt different fates
after such divisions by segregating primarily to one daughter cell. To
examine the importance of asymmetric cell division in mammalian
development, we identified two mouse <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>numb<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> genes, <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>m-numb (Numb)<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>numblike (Numbl <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>or<span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span> nbl)<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>.
We postulated that mammalian neural progenitor cells, which behave like
stem cells during neurogenesis, balance self-renewal and
differentiation by segregating Numb proteins asymmetrically to produce

an essential need to ensure a proper balance between self-renewal and

mammals. Conceptually, stem cells can simultaneously self-renew and
differentiate by dividing asymmetrically to produce one daughter cell

stem cells, which can quickly expand their population when responding
to a tissue injury, or to generate two differentiated cells, when large
numbers of stem cells are no longer necessary towards the end of
organogenesis and tissue repair. In other words, understanding the
division patterns of stem cells – particularly how they are regulated

<span style='color:red;']</span>[li]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Regulation of arterial development and branching morphogenesis<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>   The purpose of these studies is to elucidate molecular pathways leading to arterial specification of the endothelium and formation of arterial vasculature.  We have recently demonstrated that  knockout of synectin, a PDZ protein involved in endosomal trafficking of a number of TK receptor complexes leads to selective reduction in arterial morphogenesis and vascular branching (Chittenden et al Dev Cell, 2006). We have now demonstrated that synectin controls retrograde trafficking of VEGF-R2 containing endosomes via its binding to myosin-VI.  Interestingly, myosin-VI knockout in mice or knockdown in zebrafish leads to the same arteriopenic phenotype.  This abnormal receptor trafficking results in impaired activation of one of VEGF-R2 signaling pathways that appears to be crucial for arterial specification.   Rescue of this aspect of VEGF signaling fully restores arterial morphogenesis not only in synectin null or myosin-VI null mice but in other models of poor arterial development. Thus, this may be the critical pathways specifying arterial formation. Funding: NHLBI (2007-2012)   
<span style='color:red;']</span>[li]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Regulation of vascular maintenance<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>. It has not been realized until recently that maintenance of vascular integrity is an active process requiring an ongoing signaling. We have been able to demonstrate that suppression of basal FGF signaling in endothelial cells results in loss of cell-cell contacts and loss of endothelium from the vascular wall (Murakami et al. JCI 2008). The molecular events involved include FGF regulation of VE-cadherin phosphorylation and suppression of local Src activation. Current efforts are focused on characterization of the FGF signaling-VE-cadherin link and elucidation of other pathways regulating VE-cadherin maintenance t the plasma cell membrane Funding: NHLBI (2008-2013).

Over the years my lab has demonstrated that syndecan-4 plays a critical role in regulation of FGF signaling (Horowitz, JCB â€™02 and many others) and that this involves regulation of its trafficking to the plasma membrane rafts and endocytosis among other events (Tkachenko JBC â€™02, JCS â€™04, Circ Res â€™06). Recently we discovered that in addition to its role in FGF signaling syndecan-4 controls formation of mTOR complex 2 and activation of  the Akt pathway (Partovian et a l Mol Cell â€™08). Among many interesting phenotypes in syndecan-4 null is mice is arterial hypertension (lack of Akt activation leads to suppressed NO production) and defective tumor but not ischemic angiogenesis.  We are currently examining molecular events involved in syndecan-4 dependent regulation of mTORC2 formation that apparently include activation of RhoG via a novel mechanism involving sequestration of Rho-GDI (JCB, '09) Funding: NHLBI (2008-2013) <span style='color:red;']</span>[/li]</span>

<li><strong>Role of Raf1 and MAPK signaling in regulation of arterial specification:<em>  </em></strong>We find that PI3K has the ability to inhibit MAPK signaling by phosphorylating Raf1 and that activation of RAf1 leads to profound stimulation of arterial growth and arterial specification. The molecular details of this pathways are being examined in a variety of transgenic mice models   
<li>Activation of arteriogenesis in arteriogenesis-resistant states: abnormal VEGF and other angiogenic growth factor signaling may be at the core of many events associated with advanced atherosclerosis, diabetes and other angiogenic signaling-resistant states. We are testing the concept that activation of arteriogenic signaling downstream of VEGF-R2 may promore arteriogenesis and become an effective therapeutic approach. </li>

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Data show that
psychological factors play an important role in acute coronary syndromes. We
and others, have found mentally demanding tasks such as mental arithmetic to
provoke ischemia in approximately 50% of patients with ischemic heart disease.
We have also found a specific psychological profile, characterized by emotional
reactivity, and easily aroused anger and hostility, to be associated with this
â€œmental stress ischemiaâ€; conversely, we have not found an association between
this profile and exercise ischemia. Follow up of these mental stress positive
patients reveal a significantly poorer 1-2 year prognosis. Hence, mental stress
ischemia may be a distinct phenomenon with unique risk factors and prognosis.
The mechanisms of mental stress ischemia are, however, not well understood.
Critical questions remain regarding the ways by which mental and psychological
factors contribute to coronary syndromes. We believe that psychological,
neurobiological and coronary vasomotor processes are key factors, expanding
upon our pilot work, conducted in the context of our current funding. We are
examining the functional CNS correlates of mental stress ischemia; these CNS correlates
will be defined by positron emission tomography (PET) conducted while patients
perform an arithmetic task that we have found to reliably provoke ischemia in

The overarching research theme of
our research is the elucidation of those mechanisms, which transduce cognitive
stress as a provocation of myocardial ischemia. Specifically, we are interested
in the neurobiology and coronary flow dynamics that results from mentally
stressful tasks. Our work utilizes simultaneous
measurements of brain activation and myocardial function/coronary flow with
PET imaging, echocardiography and pulse arterial tonometry during laboratory
mental stress. We are developing conceptual constructs based upon our previous

activation maps

Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[A deep commitment to academic medicine has fundamentally influenced my research interests, from years of basic molecular neuroscience research to becoming a double-boarded physician in Adult Neurology and Clinical Genetics with a continuing involvement in basic and translational research. My early studies focused on how conserved genetic programs can change in mature neurons in response to specific, transmitter-receptor mediated signals. The realization, that dynamic alteration of genetic programs may also play a fundamental role in pathological processes, led to my focus on how various layers of genomic architecture are influencing a phenotype in health and disease.    <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>1. Exploitation of rare genetic disorders with Mendelian trait may provide novel insights into mechanisms of common disorders and complex biological processes, such as dementia, diabetes or aging, and recognized disease pathways can offer strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.   <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>   Among the simple Mendelian disorders of humans, Werner syndrome most closely resembles an acceleration of normal aging. In prior studies I demonstrated that WRN protein directly interacts with the DNA replication machinery. To define better cellular events that are specifically vulnerable to WRN deficiency, I used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence the expression of Wrn gene and other RecQ helicases, linked to different clinical phenotypes, in primary human fibroblasts. The series of investigations strongly suggest that defects in DNA repair of specific lesions produced by oxidative damage in slowly dividing or non-dividing cells account for those unique aspects of Werner syndrome that mimic normal aging. We also propose that over time these DNA lesions would also accumulate in stem/precursor cells impairing their replicative capacity, thereby contributing to the complex aging phenotype. Our observations attest to the concept that in metazoan models of aging most pathology occurs in organs made up of slowly dividing or non-dividing cells and that impaired DNA repair and genomic instability, driven by oxidative damage, may underlie normal human aging. These studies further fostered some of the current projects to understand the role of oxygen environment on stem cell pluripotency, stem cell aging and neural lineage specification.   <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>2. Genetic mapping, identifying contributing gene mutations and variants, is only an initial step toward biological understanding of rare or common diseases. Creation of disease models, both in human cell culture and animals, is crucial. Human embryonic stem (hES) cells offer an unprecedented access to the earliest stage of development and modeling cell fate and function. In particular, molecular changes that arise during neuronal differentiation and fate specification can be elucidated that may offer key understanding of normal and abnormal human neural development and disease processes.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>   We are using a multifaceted approach with investigators of the Yale Stem Cell Center, integrating genomic, proteomic, and genetic experiments to elucidate the molecular events that control neural cell differentiation using hES cells as model system. We have analyzed global transcriptome changes that occur during the early differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into the neural lineage. Next generation, state-of-the-art sequencing analysis revealed a remarkable complexity in gene transcription and splicing dynamics during neural cell differentiation with a wealth of previously unannotated novel transcripts and spliced isoforms specific for each stage of differentiation. My current efforts are focused on a novel type of unbiased, genome-wide functional screen to identify genetic mechanisms that control the steps of the neural differentiation in hES cells. These studies and the platform would offer targets for more downstream goals, including mechanistic investigations or drug discovery.    <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Further, in a collaborative project within Yale, we investigate the effect of hypoxia in neural stem cell function to identify key genes and their networks that enable neuronal stem cells to repair the injured brain in mouse model of perinatal hypoxia and elucidate the role of these genes for human neuronal stem cell function. The project may provide clues how to promote neuronal stem cell regenerative potential in traumatic, vascular and degenerative disorders of the human brain.   <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>3. To understand the genetic and molecular underpinnings of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, we capitalize on the recent technical development of reprogramming adult, differentiated somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells. These <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> can be derived with a specific genetic and disease background and can differentiate into essentially any cell types of the body. Thus, by using patient-specific cells one may gain knowledge of key molecular players and abnormalities of neural fate determination and function to understand monogenic or complex developmental and degenerative brain disorders. This would not be otherwise possible to do in living CNS.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>   With other Yale investigators with interest in neurogenetics, we have recently launched the Program in Neurodevelopment and Regeneration and began to generate iPS cell lines derived directly from patients with various neurodevelopmental disorders with notable genetic component, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We are particularly interested to understand if macrocephaly, a well replicated phenotype in ASD, may be related to intrinsic alterations neuronal stem cell properties governing cell proliferation and/or neural and glial differentiation and how these processes align with the patient-specific genomic architecture. Advanced technologies are used to reprogram skin cells, obtain data on patient-specific DNA variations and integrate with quantitative gene expression information and correlative epigenetic regulatory marks along with phenotypic analysis of neural differentiation.  These projects may provide an exceptional chance to understand the genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying this complex disorder and also to correlate with the clinical phenotype. As a model in general, iPS cells provide an invaluable resource for in vitro disease modeling, pharmaceutical screening (drugs/small molecules) and potential for cell-replacement therapy.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>4.

										<li>A deep commitment to academic medicine has fundamentally influenced my research interests, from years of basic molecular neuroscience research to becoming a double-boarded physician in Adult Neurology and Clinical Genetics with a continuing involvement in basic and translational research. My early studies focused on how conserved genetic programs can change in mature neurons in response to specific, transmitter-receptor mediated signals. The realization, that dynamic alteration of genetic programs may also play a fundamental role in pathological processes, led to my focus on how various layers of genomic architecture are influencing a phenotype in health and disease.    <br><br>1. Exploitation of rare genetic disorders with Mendelian trait may provide novel insights into mechanisms of common disorders and complex biological processes, such as dementia, diabetes or aging, and recognized disease pathways can offer strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.   <br>   Among the simple Mendelian disorders of humans, Werner syndrome most closely resembles an acceleration of normal aging. In prior studies I demonstrated that WRN protein directly interacts with the DNA replication machinery. To define better cellular events that are specifically vulnerable to WRN deficiency, I used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence the expression of Wrn gene and other RecQ helicases, linked to different clinical phenotypes, in primary human fibroblasts. The series of investigations strongly suggest that defects in DNA repair of specific lesions produced by oxidative damage in slowly dividing or non-dividing cells account for those unique aspects of Werner syndrome that mimic normal aging.

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[The Vaccarino laboratory has elucidated crucial mechanisms that regulate neural stem cell self-renewal, survival and differentiation. The lab has been redefining the roles of astroglial cellsâ€”extremely diverse cellular elements that evolve from a primary role of neural progenitors during embryonic development, to essential partners in neuronal migration, maturation, axon guidance. These cells have essential metabolic function in the adult brain and retain ability to divide and act as precursors.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>In the 1990â€™s Vaccarino and colleagues reported that an extracellular protein called Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) increases the number of progenitors for excitatory cortical neurons in vitro (Vaccarino et al., 1995) and that a single microinjection of FGF2 into the cerebral ventricles of rat embryos doubled the number of excitatory neurons generated during cortical development (Vaccarino et al., 1999). This was the first evidence that a single factor can elicit a permanent increase in cerebral cortical size and neuron number in a mammalian species. Conversely, using knockout mice, Vaccarino and colleagues demonstrated that the Fgf2 gene product is essential for the generation of a normal number of excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex by increasing cell proliferation in the cortical neuroepithelium (Vaccarino et al., 1999; Raballo et al., 2000; Korada et al., 2002). Subsequent work of demonstrated that FGF receptors are essential for normal telencephalic development. The disruption of the Fgfr1 gene is sufficient to thwart cell proliferation within the hippocampal primordium, causing lifelong hippocampal atrophy (Ohkubo et al., 2004). In contrast, the antagonism of all FGF receptors is required to disrupt cortical development. Driving a dominant negative Fgfr1 to the cortical primordium resulted in decreased generation and lower numbers of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, which form the primary scaffold of the cortex, and cortical atrophy (Shin et al., 2004). <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>In the evolution of this research, Vaccarino and her colleagues discovered that FGF receptors play an indirect but crucial role in the development of inhibitory neurons. A lower number of inhibitory neurons containing parvalbumin was observed in the adult cerebral cortex of both Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 null mutant mice (Muller Smith et al., 2008). Recent data suggest that the GABA neuron defect is attributable to their deficient maturation or survival during early postnatal development. Further, the stereotypic locomotor hyperactivity exhibited by FGF receptor mutant mice was inversely proportional to the number of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons in their cerebral cortex (Muller Smith et al., 2008). Interestingly, parallel work in postmortem human brains performed by the same lab showed that the same parvalbumin inhibitory neurons are decreased in number within the caudate nucleus of patients with Tourette syndrome (Kalanithi et al., 2005). It is also known that cortical parvalbumin neurons are decreased in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The lab is now focused on elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control parvalbumin neuron differentiation and survival throughout early postnatal development. These processes may require paracrine astroglia-neuron signaling, which requires FGF receptors. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Another idea that has been put forward by the Vaccarino laboratory is that cortical neurogenesis does not abruptly stop at birth but that the immature brain has the capacity to produce new cortical neurons, a process that is enhanced by injury. The lab has observed that after neonatal hypoxia, the excitatory neuron losses spontaneously recover in the cerebral cortex (Fagel et al., 2006, and Fagel et al., 2009). During this phase there is a prominent increase in cell proliferation and neurogenesis, along with an increase in expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 in the forebrain germinal zones (Ganat et al, 2002). The proliferation, neurogenesis and ensuing neuronal recovery are both nearly absent in Fgfr1 conditional null mutant mice.  This represents the first evidence that excitatory neurons can recover after a postnatal insult and that FGFR1 in astroglial cells is centrally involved in this process (Fagel et al, 2009). <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>To further study the role of glial stem/progenitor cells in regenerative processes, the lab has generated the GFAP-CreERT2 transgenic line, in which the Cre recombinase can be transiently induced by a drug injection in astroglial cells (Ganat et al, 2006). This mouse model allows investigators to identify and follow astroglial cells and their progeny. These cells can be also genetically altered in a temporally controlled manner.  In recognition of this work, the laboratory was recently awarded a grant from the State of Connecticut to study the gene expression and fate potential of astroglial cells after hypoxic insult. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Studies are underway to reveal the mechanisms and pathways that are involved in brain adaptation and self-repair after this insult. Parallel experiments will elucidate astroglia-specific transcripts that allow these cells to undergo dramatic fate transition from quiescent to reactive/proliferative, and from glial to neuron.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>The Vaccarino research has contributed key insights into the processes that regulate the number and differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in both prenatal and postnatal development. They have proposed that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex and connected regions is regulated by developmental genes (i.e., Fgf) as well as by environmental factors (i.e., hypoxia) acting at crucial stages in development. Disruption of this delicate balance produces predictable alterations in psychomotor behavior in our animal models. These animal models mimic aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., hyperactivity, impulsivity, poor learning) and can be used to study ways to repair or reverse these deficits. The cerebral cortex and connected regions engage patterns of goal-directed behavior that are assembled during infancy. Concomitantly, the cortex represses impulsive, unwanted behaviors. Poor organization and control of cognitive and motor processes due to disrupted cortical development may be shared in various ways by schizophrenia, autism, ADHD and Touretteâ€™s Syndrome.]</span>.

Further, the stereotypic locomotor hyperactivity exhibited by FGF receptor mutant mice was inversely proportional to the number of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons in their cerebral cortex (Muller Smith et al., 2008). Interestingly, parallel work in postmortem human brains performed by the same lab showed that the same parvalbumin inhibitory neurons are decreased in number within the caudate nucleus of patients with Tourette syndrome (Kalanithi et al., 2005). It is also known that cortical parvalbumin neurons are decreased in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The lab is now focused on elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control parvalbumin neuron differentiation and survival throughout early postnatal development. These processes may require paracrine astroglia-neuron signaling, which requires FGF receptors. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Another idea that has been put forward by the Vaccarino laboratory is that cortical neurogenesis does not abruptly stop at birth but that the immature brain has the capacity to produce new cortical neurons, a process that is enhanced by injury. The lab has observed that after neonatal hypoxia, the excitatory neuron losses spontaneously recover in the cerebral cortex (Fagel et al., 2006, and Fagel et al., 2009). During this phase there is a prominent increase in cell proliferation and neurogenesis, along with an increase in expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 in the forebrain germinal zones (Ganat et al, 2002). The proliferation, neurogenesis and ensuing neuronal recovery are both nearly absent in Fgfr1 conditional null mutant mice.  This represents the first evidence that excitatory neurons can recover after a postnatal insult and that FGFR1 in astroglial cells is centrally involved in this process (Fagel et al, 2009). <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>To further study the role of glial stem/progenitor cells in regenerative processes, the lab has generated the GFAP-CreERT2 transgenic line, in which the Cre recombinase can be transiently induced by a drug injection in astroglial cells (Ganat et al, 2006). This mouse model allows investigators to identify and follow astroglial cells and their progeny. These cells can be also genetically altered in a temporally controlled manner.  In recognition of this work, the laboratory was recently awarded a grant from the State of Connecticut to study the gene expression and fate potential of astroglial cells after hypoxic insult. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Studies are underway to reveal the mechanisms and pathways that are involved in brain adaptation and self-repair after this insult. Parallel experiments will elucidate astroglia-specific transcripts that allow these cells to undergo dramatic fate transition from quiescent to reactive/proliferative, and from glial to neuron.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>The Vaccarino research has contributed key insights into the processes that regulate the number and differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in both prenatal and postnatal development. They have proposed that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex and connected regions is regulated by developmental genes (i.e., Fgf) as well as by environmental factors (i.e., hypoxia) acting at crucial stages in development. Disruption of this delicate balance produces predictable alterations in psychomotor behavior in our animal models. These animal models mimic aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., hyperactivity, impulsivity, poor learning) and can be used to study ways to repair or reverse these deficits. The cerebral cortex and connected regions engage patterns of goal-directed behavior that are assembled during infancy. Concomitantly, the cortex represses impulsive, unwanted behaviors. Poor organization and control of cognitive and motor processes due to disrupted cortical development may be shared in various ways by schizophrenia, autism, ADHD and Tourette’s Syndrome.

										<li>The Vaccarino laboratory has elucidated crucial mechanisms that regulate neural stem cell self-renewal, survival and differentiation. The lab has been redefining the roles of astroglial cellsâ€”extremely diverse cellular elements that evolve from a primary role of neural progenitors during embryonic development, to essential partners in neuronal migration, maturation, axon guidance. These cells have essential metabolic function in the adult brain and retain ability to divide and act as precursors.  <br><br>In the 1990â€™s Vaccarino and colleagues reported that an extracellular protein called Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) increases the number of progenitors for excitatory cortical neurons in vitro (Vaccarino et al., 1995) and that a single microinjection of FGF2 into the cerebral ventricles of rat embryos doubled the number of excitatory neurons generated during cortical development (Vaccarino et al., 1999). This was the first evidence that a single factor can elicit a permanent increase in cerebral cortical size and neuron number in a mammalian species. Conversely, using knockout mice, Vaccarino and colleagues demonstrated that the Fgf2 gene product is essential for the generation of a normal number of excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex by increasing cell proliferation in the cortical neuroepithelium (Vaccarino et al., 1999; Raballo et al., 2000; Korada et al., 2002). Subsequent work of demonstrated that FGF receptors are essential for normal telencephalic development. The disruption of the Fgfr1 gene is sufficient to thwart cell proliferation within the hippocampal primordium, causing lifelong hippocampal atrophy (Ohkubo et al., 2004). In contrast, the antagonism of all FGF receptors is required to disrupt cortical development. Driving a dominant negative Fgfr1 to the cortical primordium resulted in decreased generation and lower numbers of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, which form the primary scaffold of the cortex, and cortical atrophy (Shin et al., 2004). <br><br>In the evolution of this research, Vaccarino and her colleagues discovered that FGF receptors play an indirect but crucial role in the development of inhibitory neurons.

We are particularly interested in the mechanisms where neurotransmitters in early development may play a role in establishing and stabilizing functional neuronal circuits. To this end we use a variety of approaches including electrophysiology, tissue culture, molecular biology, ultrastructural immunocytochemistry, and digital imaging to study the general question from converging perspectives relating both to neuronal structure and function. A particular area of interest within the brain is the hypothalamus that acts as a homeostatic regulator controlling the endocrine system, biological rhythms, cardiovascular system, and general autonomic tone.</ins>

research<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>: As a
postdoctoral fellow, I examined the genetic and molecular mechanisms that
regulate patterning and morphogenesis of the mammalian limb. I worked with Drs.
Lee Niswander and Kathryn Anderson at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
Part of my work focused on a gene, Lrp4 that is required for limb patterning. I
have studied how Lrp4 acts in the limb in conjunction with other developmental
pathways to specify the AER and have explored how this gene ties into known
developmental genetic pathways.  In
the course of these studies, I found that Lrp4 is required for a variety of
different developmental processes, including formation of the neuromuscular
junction. In parallel studies, I also studied how homologous limbs diverge in
different mammalian lineages by comparing the mechanisms of limb patterning
between the mouse and the bat. 

 

Lrp4 is a critical factor
for limb patterning and development

I
identified Lrp4 as a gene mutated in 2 mouse lines derived from a forward
genetics screen. Lrp4 is required at the early limb bud stage (E9.5), a time
when the AER is first formed.  In
the absence of Lrp4 function, the AER cells fail to compact at the
dorsal-ventral interface of the limb; the result is a broadened AER at the
distal edge of the limb with cells that lack their characteristic columnar
shape.  As the AER is a crucial organizer
of limb outgrowth, disruptions in its morphogenesis can explain most of the
subsequent defects in limb development in Lrp4 mutants. Based on homology, Lrp4
is most closely related to Lrp5 and Lrp6, which are required for canonical Wnt
signaling, however I tested the hypothesis that Lrp4 affects Wnt signaling and
concluded that this is not the case in the early limb. Lrp4 is expressed in a
complex pattern during development, including the teeth, kidneys, mammary buds
and vibrissae, and that mutants show defects in each of the tissues where the
gene is expressed.  

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span> Divergence of vertebrate
limb morphology: how the bat got its wings

I have
continued my interest in the morphological diversification of homologous
structures by studying the bat wing. The evolution of bat wing membranes and
powered flight must have depended on mechanisms to retain and elaborate
interdigit tissue. I identified a novel mechanism
utilized in the bat wing to prevent apoptosis and interdigital regression
involving a unique domain of Fgf8 expression in bat forelimb interdigits. In
addition, high expression levels of the potent Bmp inhibitor Gremlin is found
in bat forelimb interdigits but not in the un-webbed hindlimbs. By growing bat
limbs in culture and experimentally manipulating these signals, I found that
the combined action of increased Bmp and decreased Fgf signaling results in
extensive forelimb interdigital apoptosis. Thus it appears that in the bat
wing, inhibition of Bmp and activation of Fgf signaling cooperate to prevent
interdigital cell death.  These
data indicate that although there is not a conserved mechanism for maintaining
interdigit tissue across amniotes. In the bat, the expression in the bat
forelimb interdigits of Gremlin and Fgf8 suggests that these key molecular
changes underlie the evolution of the bat wing membrane.

Characterization of
additional genes affecting limb morphology

From a
subsequent round of mutagenesis screening in Dr. Andersonâ€™s lab, I identified 3
additional mutant lines that display abnormal limb patterning and
morphogenesis, as well as defects in other organs.  We are continuing to work on these lines to identify the
affected gene and determine the roles of these genes in limb and organ
development.

 

Lrp4 and Shd, two genes that control formation
of the AER

The AER
plays a pivotal role in limb development through its signaling interactions
with limb bud mesenchyme. Despite recent advances in defining some of the major
genes necessary to form a limb, our understanding of how the AER is established
and refined through the migration and compaction of Fgf8-expressing cells is
not understood.  I am currently
working with two mutant lines, Lrp4 and a new mutant line, shorthand (shd), that show dorsal-ventral expansion
of the AER during early limb development to examine the early steps of AER
morphogenesis and AER maintenance.

 

While the
role of Lrp4 in limb development is unresolved, the early expansion of the AER
suggests that Lrp4 is critical for determining the number of cells adopting an
AER fate and also for setting the boundaries of the AER. My in vivo studies demonstrate expansion of
both Fgf and Bmp signaling in the early Lrp4 mutant limbs.  As both of these signaling pathways
contribute to AER formation and Fgf8 expression in the early limb, the
expansion of either could underlie the broadening of the AER in Lrp4 mutants.
<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Our preliminary experiments in Xenopus (in collaboration with Dr. Xi Heâ€™s
laboratory) do not corroborate this. 
Dorsal injection of Lrp4 mRNA does not inhibit Wnt-mediated dorsal axis
specification and co-injection of Lrp4 and Wnt8 did not inhibit activation of
the Wnt-target Xnr3.  Thus, further
study is required to determine the signaling pathway(s) affected by Lrp4.

 

The
expanded AER phenotype in line shd occurs slightly later than Lrp4 mutants, suggesting that
maintenance of the normal boundaries of the AER is disrupted in shd mutants.  Exploration of this phenotype will shed light on the factors
required for maintenance of a discreet border between AER and limb ectoderm.
Line shd has
been mapped to a gene-dense genomic interval and should be cloned shortly. How
the early signaling pathways, including Bmps and Wnts converge on Fgf8 in the
early limb and what factors regulate the morphology of AER are not understood.
In my laboratory, I will use genetic interaction experiments between Lrp4, shd,
Wnt and Bmp pathway components and their inhibitors to define the role of these
genes in establishing normal number of cells in the AER, and setting its
borders and directing AER morphogenesis.

additional mutant lines that display abnormal limb patterning and

Dorsal injection of Lrp4 mRNA does not inhibit Wnt-mediated dorsal axis
specification and co-injection of Lrp4 and Wnt8 did not inhibit activation of
the Wnt-target Xnr3.  Thus, further
study is required to determine the signaling pathway(s) affected by Lrp4.

 

The
expanded AER phenotype in line shd occurs slightly later than Lrp4 mutants, suggesting that
maintenance of the normal boundaries of the AER is disrupted in shd mutants.  Exploration of this phenotype will shed light on the factors

In my laboratory, I will use genetic interaction experiments between Lrp4, shd,
Wnt and Bmp pathway components and their inhibitors to define the role of these
genes in establishing normal number of cells in the AER, and setting its
borders and directing AER morphogenesis.

development.  The characterization and cloning of the genes affected in
these mutants should provide a better understanding of
anterior-posterior and proximal-distal patterning during limb

have led to a deeper understanding of how the Hox genes control and diversify
body plans and of their role in the evolution of body parts and patterns. 

<br><br><em> Postdoctoral
research</em>: As a
postdoctoral fellow, I examined the genetic and molecular mechanisms that
regulate patterning and morphogenesis of the mammalian limb. I worked with Drs.
Lee Niswander and Kathryn Anderson at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
Part of my work focused on a gene, Lrp4 that is required for limb patterning. I
have studied how Lrp4 acts in the limb in conjunction with other developmental
pathways to specify the AER and have explored how this gene ties into known
developmental genetic pathways.  In
the course of these studies, I found that Lrp4 is required for a variety of
different developmental processes, including formation of the neuromuscular
junction. In parallel studies, I also studied how homologous limbs diverge in
different mammalian lineages by comparing the mechanisms of limb patterning
between the mouse and the bat. 

 

Lrp4 is a critical factor
for limb patterning and development

I
identified Lrp4 as a gene mutated in 2 mouse lines derived from a forward
genetics screen. Lrp4 is required at the early limb bud stage (E9.5), a time
when the AER is first formed.  In
the absence of Lrp4 function, the AER cells fail to compact at the
dorsal-ventral interface of the limb; the result is a broadened AER at the
distal edge of the limb with cells that lack their characteristic columnar
shape.  As the AER is a crucial organizer
of limb outgrowth, disruptions in its morphogenesis can explain most of the
subsequent defects in limb development in Lrp4 mutants. Based on homology, Lrp4
is most closely related to Lrp5 and Lrp6, which are required for canonical Wnt
signaling, however I tested the hypothesis that Lrp4 affects Wnt signaling and
concluded that this is not the case in the early limb. Lrp4 is expressed in a
complex pattern during development, including the teeth, kidneys, mammary buds
and vibrissae, and that mutants show defects in each of the tissues where the
gene is expressed.  

<br><br> Divergence of vertebrate
limb morphology: how the bat got its wings

I have
continued my interest in the morphological diversification of homologous
structures by studying the bat wing. The evolution of bat wing membranes and
powered flight must have depended on mechanisms to retain and elaborate
interdigit tissue. I identified a novel mechanism
utilized in the bat wing to prevent apoptosis and interdigital regression
involving a unique domain of Fgf8 expression in bat forelimb interdigits. In
addition, high expression levels of the potent Bmp inhibitor Gremlin is found
in bat forelimb interdigits but not in the un-webbed hindlimbs. By growing bat
limbs in culture and experimentally manipulating these signals, I found that
the combined action of increased Bmp and decreased Fgf signaling results in
extensive forelimb interdigital apoptosis. Thus it appears that in the bat
wing, inhibition of Bmp and activation of Fgf signaling cooperate to prevent
interdigital cell death.  These
data indicate that although there is not a conserved mechanism for maintaining
interdigit tissue across amniotes. In the bat, the expression in the bat
forelimb interdigits of Gremlin and Fgf8 suggests that these key molecular
changes underlie the evolution of the bat wing membrane.

<br><br>Ongoing
and future research</em>:  

Characterization of
additional genes affecting limb morphology

From a
subsequent round of mutagenesis screening in Dr. Andersonâ€™s lab, I identified 3
additional mutant lines that display abnormal limb patterning and
morphogenesis, as well as defects in other organs.  We are continuing to work on these lines to identify the
affected gene and determine the roles of these genes in limb and organ
development.

 

Lrp4 and Shd, two genes that control formation
of the AER

The AER
plays a pivotal role in limb development through its signaling interactions
with limb bud mesenchyme. Despite recent advances in defining some of the major
genes necessary to form a limb, our understanding of how the AER is established
and refined through the migration and compaction of Fgf8-expressing cells is
not understood.  I am currently
working with two mutant lines, Lrp4 and a new mutant line, shorthand (shd), that show dorsal-ventral expansion
of the AER during early limb development to examine the early steps of AER
morphogenesis and AER maintenance.

 

While the
role of Lrp4 in limb development is unresolved, the early expansion of the AER
suggests that Lrp4 is critical for determining the number of cells adopting an
AER fate and also for setting the boundaries of the AER. My in vivo studies demonstrate expansion of
both Fgf and Bmp signaling in the early Lrp4 mutant limbs.  As both of these signaling pathways
contribute to AER formation and Fgf8 expression in the early limb, the
expansion of either could underlie the broadening of the AER in Lrp4 mutants.
<br><br>Our preliminary experiments in Xenopus (in collaboration with Dr. Xi Heâ€™s
laboratory) do not corroborate this. 
Dorsal injection of Lrp4 mRNA does not inhibit Wnt-mediated dorsal axis
specification and co-injection of Lrp4 and Wnt8 did not inhibit activation of
the Wnt-target Xnr3.  Thus, further
study is required to determine the signaling pathway(s) affected by Lrp4.

 

The
expanded AER phenotype in line shd occurs slightly later than Lrp4 mutants, suggesting that
maintenance of the normal boundaries of the AER is disrupted in shd mutants.  Exploration of this phenotype will shed light on the factors
required for maintenance of a discreet border between AER and limb ectoderm.
Line shd has
been mapped to a gene-dense genomic interval and should be cloned shortly. How
the early signaling pathways, including Bmps and Wnts converge on Fgf8 in the
early limb and what factors regulate the morphology of AER are not understood.
In my laboratory, I will use genetic interaction experiments between Lrp4, shd,
Wnt and Bmp pathway components and their inhibitors to define the role of these
genes in establishing normal number of cells in the AER, and setting its
borders and directing AER morphogenesis.   

 

We are
continuing to work with these mutants to better define how Lrp4 and shd
regulate the AER.<br><br>In terms of
human relevance, one of the most common types of birth defects is
deformation of the limbs.  However, little is known about the
developmental, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying these
defects. Identification of the molecular mechanisms that pattern limbs
will lead to a better understanding of the possible causes of human
limb defects.

										<li>										Limbs have played a crucial role in animal evolution. The evolution of wings is recognized as the key innovation
behind the evolutionary success of the insects, while the adaptive evolution of
vertebrates to aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial environments involved the
acquisition and modification of their limbs.  My interests in the establishment, patterning and
development of limbs have led me to work in both arthropods and chordates. 

 

<br><br><em>Graduate
research</em>: As a
graduate student with Sean Carroll at the University
of Wisconsin, Madison, I investigated the regulatory networks governed
by the Homeotic (Hox) genes that control the differentiation of serially
homologous structures within an individual species and the divergence of
homologs between species. I utilized the insect wing (in the fruitfly Drosophila
melanogaster and
the butterfly Precis coenia) as a model system to gain a fundamental
understanding of how the Hox class of transcription factors controlled the
placement and morphology of insect flight appendages and how this regulation
might have changed over the course of evolution. We initially set out to better
define the role of Hox genes in regulating wing number.  I discovered that no Hox genes were
required to promote wing development, in Drosophila contrasting with previous notions,
but instead that Hox genes in wingless segments repress wing development.  <br><br>I further examined Hox gene expression
in a primitive wingless insect and discovered that the domains of Ultrabithorax
(Ubx) and Abdominal-A (Abd-A) were largely similar to those in Drosophila. As wing-like protrusions first
appear on all segments in fossil insects, this suggests that Hox genes acquired
their wing-repressive role over the course of insect wing evolution.  I went on to show that in addition to
its wing-repressive ability in the abdomen, Ubx regulates the identity of the D.
melanogaster
hindwing (haltere) by acting independently on selected subsets of genes
downstream of the global wing organizing signals and at multiple levels of the
wing developmental patterning hierarchy. Further, using a unique strain of P.
coenia, which
displayed homeotic transformations on their hindwings, I showed that Ubx
regulates a different set of target genes in butterflies compared to fruit
flies.  Together, these studies
have led to a deeper understanding of how the Hox genes control and diversify
body plans and of their role in the evolution of body parts and patterns.

These receptors can be divided into two groups: one couples to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins; and the other binds to ligands including hedgehog proteins and Wnt proteins. Currently, we are focusing on chemoattractant and Wnt-activated signaling.

Chemoattractants, including the superfamily of chemotactic cytokines, chemokines, play an important role in host defense by attracting and activating leukocytes at sites of injury and infection. However, their unchecked activities contribute to may inflammation-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, tumorigenesis, and various allergies. Work in my lab has made significant contributions to the understanding of signaling mechanisms and functions of a number of chemoattractant-activated pathways. These include pathways linked by PLC ÃŸ, PI3K?, PIXa/Pak/Cdc42, PTEN, P-Rex1, and Myo1f. We are continuing to use a combination of molecular and cell biological, biochemical, transgenic, functional genomic, and proteomic approaches to characterize novel chemoattractant signaling mechanisms and study their functions in cell migration and inflammation-related paradigms.

The Wnt family of secretory glycoproteins participates in a wide variety of developmental events including, control of cell growth, generation of cell polarity, and specification of cell fate. Wnt pathways have been also closely linked to tumorigenesis and bone formation. Most notable contributions from my is the discovery of the interaction between Wnt coreceptor LRP-5 and Axin, which provides the first connection from a Wnt receptor to a intracellular signaling component and the characterization of the role of Dkk2 in regulation of osteogenic differentiation.

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[I began my research career as a graduate student with the University of California San Franciscoâ€™s Child Trauma Research Project. This was a hospital-based program under the direction of Drs. Alicia Lieberman and Patricia Van Horn.  I worked within their program for three years and was intimately involved in their NIMH funded research project studying the efficacy and manualization of Child-Parent Psychotherapy for young children exposed to violence.  I interviewed mothers, conducted assessments with young children, coded video play sessions, and aided in data management. In addition to my research experience and work, I was trained and supervised in Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP).  After working with this research team, I became interested in the relationships that children had with their previously violent fathers.  I developed my own study, which became my doctoral dissertation, examining the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional implications of father visitation in domestic violence families.  Results revealed that preschool aged children with little to no contact with their fathers had higher rates of internalizing symptoms regardless of the severity of violence perpetrated by the father toward the mother.  In addition, children (especially boys) who had more contact with their fathers had fewer negative representations of their mothers in play.  These data suggest that ending the violence and continuing contact with fathers when possible can yield better outcomes for children.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>I came to the Yale Child Study Center to complete my internship and postdoctoral training.  Over the last 5 years, I have been involved in patient-oriented research particularly focused on intervention development, evaluation and dissemination for families experiencing domestic violence.  I have published multiple papers and research studies from this work.  The most recently accepted manuscripts detail the results of a longitudinal study based on a successful grant application to the Ethel F. Donaghue Womenâ€™s Health Research at Yale. This study examined the impact of an innovative domestic violence home visit intervention (DVHVI) on repeat violence rates in the home, victimsâ€™ engagement in supportive and therapeutic services for themselves and their children. One hundred and nine women were recruited to participate in the longitudinal evaluation study (N= 53 intervention and 56 controls).  Women were interviewed at baseline, within 30 days of the initial domestic incident that required standard police intervention and qualified them for the study, then again at 6 months and 1 year following the initial interview (Stover, Berkman, Desai,&Marans, in press).  Additionally, I have studied police record and clinical data on a large sample of domestic violence victims referred for services to help determine factors associated with engagement in the domestic violence outreach service (Stover, Rainey, Berkman&amp;Marans, 2008) and which components of the DVHVI might impact increased utilization of police (Stover, Poole,&amp;Marans, 2009).  I have been a co-investigator on the SAMHSA funded Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI) pilot evaluation.  The CFTSI is a 4-session secondary prevention model to prevent the development of PTSD following exposure to a traumatic event.  A randomized pilot was completed in the summer 2009 and findings suggest the CFTSI is a powerful PTSD prevention stategy.  We have begun dissemination training using a learning collaborative methodology in Child Advocacy Centers in New York City.  Weâ€™ve been collecting data on implementation of the CFTSI to aid in a future RTC.   I have responded to over 100 domestic violence incidents and provided in-home and office consultation to families following police intervention. Through my research and clinical work with these families, I became aware of the need for more coordinated and integrated treatments that address issues of domestic violence, substance abuse, trauma, and parenting that are not fully addressed by the intervention models that I have been trained to use with this population.  This led me to begin developing a new intervention approach (Integrated Father Treatment for DV).  I was recently awarded a small direct service grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and began the development of IFT-DV for fathers with co-morbid substance abuse and domestic violence problems who have children under the age of 7 years.  In conjunction, I have been awarded a K23 to develop and conduct a pilot evaluation of this integrated treatment for fathers.   This program of research will support the following research projects: 1) collection of quanitative data on the self-reported parenting stress, behaviors, and child-parent relationships of male perpetrators of intimate partner violence with comorbid substance abuse compared to matched controls and 2) manual development and initial evaluation via a Stage 1b randomized pilot of Integrated Father Treatment for Domestic Violence (IFT-DV) for this population of men which incorporates state-of-the-art substance abuse, domestic violence, and child-trauma treatment approaches.   Social service systems rarely acknowledge the status of men as fathers in the conceptualization and delivery of treatment for substance abuse or domestic violence.  Although there has been extensive focus on the treatment of mothers who abuse substances, are victims of intimate partner violence (IPV), or maltreat their children, there has been little consideration of the need for interventions for fathers with histories of co-morbid IPV and substance abuse.  The enormous rates of intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and child maltreatment constitute a major public health concern.   Given the high rates of comorbidity, there is a pressing need for more integrated evidence-based treatments to address the issues facing these families.]</span>.

This program of research will support the following research projects: 1) collection of quanitative data on the self-reported parenting stress, behaviors, and child-parent relationships of male perpetrators of intimate partner violence with comorbid substance abuse compared to matched controls and 2) manual development and initial evaluation via a Stage 1b randomized pilot of Integrated Father Treatment for Domestic Violence (IFT-DV) for this population of men which incorporates state-of-the-art substance abuse, domestic violence, and child-trauma treatment approaches.   Social service systems rarely acknowledge the status of men as fathers in the conceptualization and delivery of treatment for substance abuse or domestic violence.  Although there has been extensive focus on the treatment of mothers who abuse substances, are victims of intimate partner violence (IPV), or maltreat their children, there has been little consideration of the need for interventions for fathers with histories of co-morbid IPV and substance abuse.  The enormous rates of intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and child maltreatment constitute a major public health concern.   Given the high rates of comorbidity, there is a pressing need for more integrated evidence-based treatments to address the issues facing these families<ins class='diffins'>.Annie E</ins>.<ins class='diffins'> Casey Foundation       06/01/2008-05/31/2010 Integrated Father Treatment for Domestic Violence Role:  Principal Investigator</ins><br><br><ins class='diffins'>NIDA 1K23DA023334-01A2 07/01/09-06/30/14 Integrated Treatment for Fathers who Perpetrate Domestic Violence-Treatment Development Study</ins>

										<li>My longstanding interest is identification of neural circuitry abnormalities using multimodal neuroimaging techniques and investigation of how genetic variations influence neural circuitry to produce the clinical phenotypes of mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. My primary research interests lie in developing novel multimodal magnetic resonance imaging techniques to characterize the critical neural circuitry abnormalities underlying these disorders and identifying the specific genetic variations that contribute to them. Our work in translational research will contribute to elucidating the neuropathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disorders, aid in the development of new methods for early detection, and importantly, improve treatment of debilitating psychiatric illnesses. <br>1.   Methods of multimodal neuroimaging:<br>This project aims to use multimodal neuroimaging techniques to identify abnormalities of important neural circuitry in mental disorders. I developed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) methods to study the cingulum, a white matter structure important in cortico-limbic circuitry. My work demonstrated abnormalities in the anterior cingulum in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; however, findings demonstrate a different distribution of white matter abnormalities in the two disorders. I have also developed functional magnetic resonance imaging methods to study cortico-limbic functional connectivity to be integrated with DTI methods. Using these methodologies, I have obtained exciting findings that demonstrate altered structural and functional connectivity in cortico-limbic neural circuitry in mood disorders. Moreover, I have identified an association between structural and functional connectivity within this circuitry in bipolar disorder, providing some of the first evidence that these structural abnormalities may contribute to disruptions in the ability of the cortical region to modulate the functioning of limbic structure in mood disorders. <br>2.   Integration of multimodal neuroimaging and molecular genetics:<br>This project aims to develop translational research approaches of integrating molecular genetics with multimodal neuroimaging to identify novel effects of genetic variations on cortico-limbic circuitry in mental disorders. I have reported an important finding of the influence of genetic variation in neuregulin 1 on dorsal frontotemporal white matter connection abnormalities in schizophrenia. I have also recently authored psychiatric genetic papers in mood disorders including a paper that reports a novel finding of an association between variation in the vascular endothelial growth factor gene and cortico-limbic structure and on two papers on the association between the brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor gene/serotonin transporter protein gene and cortico-limbic structure/function in bipolar disorder.

This diversity is achieved through a complex series of molecular events that result in direct modification of Ig gene sequences with consequent changes in the specificity of the encoding antibodies.  In the first step of immune diversification, variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments of the Ig genes are assembled in immature B cells by a site-specific reaction known as V(D)J recombination.  This process occurs in the bone marrow early in B cell development and results in the production of a pool of mature B cells, each expressing a unique immunoglobulin B cell receptor.</ins></P><P  style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><ins class='diffins'>Upon antigenic stimulation of mature B cells, germinal centers are formed where, in mice and humans, two additional DNA modification reactions serve to further diversify the immune response: somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR).  SHM introduces point mutations into the variable region of Ig heavy and light chain genes.  This process underlies affinity maturation and results in the selection of a B cell that produces an antibody with high affinity for its target antigen. CSR is a deletion event that combines the variable region with different constant regions to result in the production of different immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG, IgE, or IgA).  The enzyme activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a cytidine deaminase that initiates these processes by introducing point mutations into the Ig variable regions (for SHM) and double-stranded DNA breaks into the Ig class switch regions (for CSR).</ins></P><P  style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><ins class='diffins'>During the first phase of SHM and CSR, AID converts cytosine to uracil to result in a uracil-guanine (U-G) mismatch.  Spontaneous U-G mismatches are normally corrected by high-fidelity base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR) pathways.  However, during the second phase of SHM and CSR, U-G mismatches are repaired by error-prone, low-fidelity BER and MMR pathways to yield mutations (for SHM) and DNA strand lesions (for CSR).</ins></P><P  style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><ins class='diffins'>The intrinsic activity of AID is that of a DNA mutator and tight regulation is required to restrict this activity to the appropriate cell type and target loci in order to avoid mutations throughout the genome.  However, aberrant targeting of AID activity contributes to translocations and point mutations of proto-oncogenes associated with many malignancies of B cell origin.  Thus, the mechanisms that determine which genes will be targeted by AID and the factors that regulate how mutations are subsequently processed are of central importance to our understanding of the etiology of malignant transformation.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Whole-exome sequencing has created tremendous potential for revealing the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of many forms of cancer. However, somatic mutations occur at a significant frequency within tumors of most cancer types, and identification of the mutations that are on the causative trajectory from normal tissue to cancerous tissue is challenging. We are making algorithmic advances in clustering across discrete linear sequences to enact two powerful approaches to this identification. First, we are applying maximum likelihood approaches that we have developed for model-averaged clustering in discrete linear sequences to somatic amino acid replacement mutations appearing within mutated genes. Because amino acids of proteins that are functionally important are locally clustered in domains, mutations in multiple tumors that are functionally important to the development of cancer cluster in the linear sequence of relevant genes, allowing inference of relevance and function even in cases without three-dimensional protein structure. These clustering analyses have the power to demonstrate, for instance, cross-cancer consistency in the functional importance of the DNA binding domain of tumor suppressor p53, whether in a cancer with extensive exome data (ovarian serous adenocarcinoma) or in a cancer with much less extensive exome data (e.g. rectal adenocarcinoma).<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Second, we are applying evolutionary theory to the problem of identification of the genetic architecture of underlying cancer development. The path from normal to cancerous tissue is navigated by an evolutionary process. Tools from evolutionary theory have the potential to parse those mutations that are selected within cells on the path to cancer from those mutations that arise incidentally during the somatic evolution of cancer. The theory we are applying makes use of differences in expectation for synonymous and replacement mutations. Synonymous mutations are expected to have no functional impact; thus they yield a proxy expectation for the &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; mutations, whereas carcinogenic replacement mutations will spread within tumors more frequently and are clustered within gene sequence. Our theory also employs human population polymorphism data, which most evolutionary biologists believe can be largely assumed to be neutral. This data facilitates calibration of the probable impact of replacement changes to sequence conservation by eliminating the confounding variable of the degree of purifying selection, which decreases the number of mutations observed in some genes and allows others to accumulate many mutations with little impact.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>We are extending this approach to estimating selection intensity on mutations along the trajectory toward cancer, revealing the level of selection within tumors for replacement mutations compared to synonymous mutations. This evolutionary analysis is ideal for detecting the history of selection on sites within genes during the evolution of cancer from exome sequencing data. These sites, particularly when representing gain-of-function mutations, will help identify candidate loci for pharmacological intervention. This approach will be applied to identify targets for pharmacological intervention and design &ldquo;personal genomics&rdquo; drugs appropriate for the genetics of individual cancers in individual patients. As a component of that project, we are constructing an &ldquo;active-experiment&rdquo; cancer exome database to facilitate further bioinformatics investigation of cancer exome data.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>

<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>2. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS FOR NONLINEAR MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DISEASE<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>I am developing probabilistic statistical methodologies for the mathematical modeling of disease emergence and spread. Robustness of models has usually been assessed by techniques that explore the relative impact and importance of parameters upon the mathematical behavior of the function and the mathematical predictions of the model. For diverse reasons including the difficulty or cost of acquisition, restrictions due to privacy, and urgency of analysis in the case of outbreaks, data for estimation of epidemiological parameters is often sparse. Evaluating a model with the &ldquo;best point estimate&rdquo; of sparse data may convey a misleading certitude to policy makers basing decisions on deterministic models of disease outbreak, spread, and persistence. Conversely, policy makers who are aware that models are parameterized with limited data may be dismissive of deterministic predictions that yet have significant validity. These issues may be most straightforwardly addressed by probabilistic sensitivity analysis of parameters and full uncertainty analysis of outcomes of interest. These analyses amount to accommodating the uncertainty of parameters directly into an analysis by probabilistically resampling data or likely distributions of parameters to calculate a probabilistic distribution of outcomes.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>For instance, one of the most common modeling approaches for evaluating interventions is based on differential equation models of disease such as the standard Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. In the SIR model and other more complex constructions, a closed-form solution can often be calculated for the basic reproductive number, <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>R<span style='color:red;']</span>[sub]</span>0<span style='color:red;']</span>[/sub]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>, the average number of secondary infections that would follow upon a primary infection in a na&iuml;ve host population. In a population where there is preexisting immunity due to either vaccination or previous infection, the effective reproductive number, <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>R<span style='color:red;']</span>[sub]</span>e<span style='color:red;']</span>[/sub]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>, is defined as the average number of secondary infections following a primary infection in a population that is not completely na&iuml;ve.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>is of particular interest in public health because interventions that bring its value below 1 are predicted to eradicate the disease. This deterministic threshold of is proposed as the basis for policy decisions regarding the level of interventions that should be implemented. However, the best estimates for the parameters that are needed for the closed-form solution of are inevitably inexact. To address this point, sensitivity analyses are frequently performed to evaluate models and explore the relationship between model parameters and outcomes. In such deterministic sensitivity analyses, one or more parameters are perturbed and the corresponding effects on outcomes are examined. The perturbation can be done either by evaluating the effect of arbitrarily small changes in parameter values (e.g. &plusmn; 1%) or by evaluating the effects across a range of values defined by plausible probability density functions. Because the values of other parameters are held fixed at best point estimates, these strategies do not account for interaction effects in non-linear dynamic models, and do not assess global uncertainty in outcome. Uncertainty analysis has been recommended for many fields of mathematical modeling, including medical decision making, as an optimal approach to presenting models. In the case of dynamic transmission modeling, however, authoritative best practices have not included uncertainty analyses. Modeling guidelines recommend probabilistic sensitivity analysis, in which both global parameter uncertainty and output uncertainty are addressed, as the best practice method for uncertainty analysis. Yet that ideal has not been extended to dynamic transmission models, for which its implementation has been challenging.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>We are developing methods for global probabilistic sensitivity analysis that allow the contribution of each parameter to model outcomes to be investigated while also taking into account the uncertainty of other model parameters. Uncertainty in parameter values can be accounted for by sampling randomly from empirical data or from probability density functions fit to empirical data. Depending on the instance, such sampling techniques include bootstrapping, Monte Carlo sampling, and Latin hypercube sampling. The model output generated from parameter samples can then be analyzed using linear (e.g. partial correlation coefficients), monotonic (e.g. partial rank correlation coefficients) and non-monotonic statistical tests (e.g. sensitivity index) to determine the contribution of each parameter to the variation in output values. Indeed, for a global sensitivity analysis to yield probabilities associated with outcomes that are of greatest utility to policy makers, probabilistic analyses of parameter uncertainty must be carried through to the model outcomes. For example, the probability of eradication of an epidemic is sensitive to both levels of vaccination and treatment. Moreover, a policy based on the analysis of data should take into consideration not only the best estimate of necessary action, but also the uncertainty around that outcome estimate. The former policy advice, indicating an exact cline of treatment and vaccination that should put into abeyance an influenza epidemic, is very different and can be misleading compared to the probabilistic statement, which gives a policymaker a predictive probability that a particular policy of treatment and vaccination will put into abeyance an influenza epidemic. Similar approaches applied with a next-generation matrix to rabies vaccination in Tanzania were able to demonstrate that WHO goals in two districts of 70% vaccination coverage of dogs had more than enough probability to control rabies, if only the process to achieve those not impractical goals could be mustered.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>A public health decision maker would find most useful the assignment of the probability of eradication to each level of treatment, so that they may precisely weigh the cost of intervention against the potential for failure. These probabilistic outcome distributions also feed forward extremely fluidly with cost-effectiveness estimation, a field which has embraced uncertainty analysis but which has until our recent work not incorporated uncertainty from nonlinear infectious disease models into calculations.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>]</span>.

<p>2. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS FOR NONLINEAR MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DISEASE</p>
<p>I am developing probabilistic statistical methodologies for the mathematical modeling of disease emergence and spread. Robustness of models has usually been assessed by techniques that explore the relative impact and importance of parameters upon the mathematical behavior of the function and the mathematical predictions of the model. For diverse reasons including the difficulty or cost of acquisition, restrictions due to privacy, and urgency of analysis in the case of outbreaks, data for estimation of epidemiological parameters is often sparse. Evaluating a model with the &ldquo;best point estimate&rdquo; of sparse data may convey a misleading certitude to policy makers basing decisions on deterministic models of disease outbreak, spread, and persistence. Conversely, policy makers who are aware that models are parameterized with limited data may be dismissive of deterministic predictions that yet have significant validity. These issues may be most straightforwardly addressed by probabilistic sensitivity analysis of parameters and full uncertainty analysis of outcomes of interest. These analyses amount to accommodating the uncertainty of parameters directly into an analysis by probabilistically resampling data or likely distributions of parameters to calculate a probabilistic distribution of outcomes.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the most common modeling approaches for evaluating interventions is based on differential equation models of disease such as the standard Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. In the SIR model and other more complex constructions, a closed-form solution can often be calculated for the basic reproductive number, <em>R<sub>0</sub></em>, the average number of secondary infections that would follow upon a primary infection in a na&iuml;ve host population. In a population where there is preexisting immunity due to either vaccination or previous infection, the effective reproductive number, <em>R<sub>e</sub></em>, is defined as the average number of secondary infections following a primary infection in a population that is not completely na&iuml;ve.</p>
<p>is of particular interest in public health because interventions that bring its value below 1 are predicted to eradicate the disease. This deterministic threshold of is proposed as the basis for policy decisions regarding the level of interventions that should be implemented. However, the best estimates for the parameters that are needed for the closed-form solution of are inevitably inexact. To address this point, sensitivity analyses are frequently performed to evaluate models and explore the relationship between model parameters and outcomes. In such deterministic sensitivity analyses, one or more parameters are perturbed and the corresponding effects on outcomes are examined. The perturbation can be done either by evaluating the effect of arbitrarily small changes in parameter values (e.g. &plusmn; 1%) or by evaluating the effects across a range of values defined by plausible probability density functions. Because the values of other parameters are held fixed at best point estimates, these strategies do not account for interaction effects in non-linear dynamic models, and do not assess global uncertainty in outcome. Uncertainty analysis has been recommended for many fields of mathematical modeling, including medical decision making, as an optimal approach to presenting models. In the case of dynamic transmission modeling, however, authoritative best practices have not included uncertainty analyses. Modeling guidelines recommend probabilistic sensitivity analysis, in which both global parameter uncertainty and output uncertainty are addressed, as the best practice method for uncertainty analysis. Yet that ideal has not been extended to dynamic transmission models, for which its implementation has been challenging.</p>
<p>We are developing methods for global probabilistic sensitivity analysis that allow the contribution of each parameter to model outcomes to be investigated while also taking into account the uncertainty of other model parameters. Uncertainty in parameter values can be accounted for by sampling randomly from empirical data or from probability density functions fit to empirical data. Depending on the instance, such sampling techniques include bootstrapping, Monte Carlo sampling, and Latin hypercube sampling. The model output generated from parameter samples can then be analyzed using linear (e.g. partial correlation coefficients), monotonic (e.g. partial rank correlation coefficients) and non-monotonic statistical tests (e.g. sensitivity index) to determine the contribution of each parameter to the variation in output values. Indeed, for a global sensitivity analysis to yield probabilities associated with outcomes that are of greatest utility to policy makers, probabilistic analyses of parameter uncertainty must be carried through to the model outcomes. For example, the probability of eradication of an epidemic is sensitive to both levels of vaccination and treatment. Moreover, a policy based on the analysis of data should take into consideration not only the best estimate of necessary action, but also the uncertainty around that outcome estimate. The former policy advice, indicating an exact cline of treatment and vaccination that should put into abeyance an influenza epidemic, is very different and can be misleading compared to the probabilistic statement, which gives a policymaker a predictive probability that a particular policy of treatment and vaccination will put into abeyance an influenza epidemic. Similar approaches applied with a next-generation matrix to rabies vaccination in Tanzania were able to demonstrate that WHO goals in two districts of 70% vaccination coverage of dogs had more than enough probability to control rabies, if only the process to achieve those not impractical goals could be mustered.</p>
<p>A public health decision maker would find most useful the assignment of the probability of eradication to each level of treatment, so that they may precisely weigh the cost of intervention against the potential for failure. These probabilistic outcome distributions also feed forward extremely fluidly with cost-effectiveness estimation, a field which has embraced uncertainty analysis but which has until our recent work not incorporated uncertainty from nonlinear infectious disease models into calculations.</p>

										<li>										<p><strong>1. TOOLS FOR CANCER GENETICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing has created tremendous potential for revealing the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of many forms of cancer. However, somatic mutations occur at a significant frequency within tumors of most cancer types, and identification of the mutations that are on the causative trajectory from normal tissue to cancerous tissue is challenging. We are making algorithmic advances in clustering across discrete linear sequences to enact two powerful approaches to this identification. First, we are applying maximum likelihood approaches that we have developed for model-averaged clustering in discrete linear sequences to somatic amino acid replacement mutations appearing within mutated genes. Because amino acids of proteins that are functionally important are locally clustered in domains, mutations in multiple tumors that are functionally important to the development of cancer cluster in the linear sequence of relevant genes, allowing inference of relevance and function even in cases without three-dimensional protein structure. These clustering analyses have the power to demonstrate, for instance, cross-cancer consistency in the functional importance of the DNA binding domain of tumor suppressor p53, whether in a cancer with extensive exome data (ovarian serous adenocarcinoma) or in a cancer with much less extensive exome data (e.g. rectal adenocarcinoma).</p>
<p>Second, we are applying evolutionary theory to the problem of identification of the genetic architecture of underlying cancer development. The path from normal to cancerous tissue is navigated by an evolutionary process. Tools from evolutionary theory have the potential to parse those mutations that are selected within cells on the path to cancer from those mutations that arise incidentally during the somatic evolution of cancer. The theory we are applying makes use of differences in expectation for synonymous and replacement mutations. Synonymous mutations are expected to have no functional impact; thus they yield a proxy expectation for the &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; mutations, whereas carcinogenic replacement mutations will spread within tumors more frequently and are clustered within gene sequence. Our theory also employs human population polymorphism data, which most evolutionary biologists believe can be largely assumed to be neutral. This data facilitates calibration of the probable impact of replacement changes to sequence conservation by eliminating the confounding variable of the degree of purifying selection, which decreases the number of mutations observed in some genes and allows others to accumulate many mutations with little impact.</p>
<p>We are extending this approach to estimating selection intensity on mutations along the trajectory toward cancer, revealing the level of selection within tumors for replacement mutations compared to synonymous mutations. This evolutionary analysis is ideal for detecting the history of selection on sites within genes during the evolution of cancer from exome sequencing data. These sites, particularly when representing gain-of-function mutations, will help identify candidate loci for pharmacological intervention. This approach will be applied to identify targets for pharmacological intervention and design &ldquo;personal genomics&rdquo; drugs appropriate for the genetics of individual cancers in individual patients. As a component of that project, we are constructing an &ldquo;active-experiment&rdquo; cancer exome database to facilitate further bioinformatics investigation of cancer exome data.</p>

										<li>										<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How parvoviruses enter their host cell and traffic to the nucleus</strong><br />   Parvoviruses do not have a lipid envelope, and so cannot deliver their virions into the host cell by fusing with its plasma or endosomal membranes.  These viruses have developed an alternative strategy to breach their host cell's outer membrane and gain entry into the cytoplasm.  We have recently shown that the compact, icosahedral virion of the murine parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice, MVM deploys a lipolytic enzyme, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) that is expressed at the N-terminus of the minor coat protein, VP1.  This region of VP1 is normally sequestered within the viral shell, but is extruded during the entry process as a capsid-tethered domain, via an 8&Aring; pore that extends through the prominent 5-fold cylinder. [Figure] In addition to the PLA2 domain, the extruded VP1 N-terminus also displays a number of small protein interaction domains predicted to engage both ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 family, involved in endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, and nuclear transport proteins of the alpha-importin family.  We are currently collaborating with Dr. Michael Hodsdon, in our Department, to determine the structure of this polypeptide domain by NMR spectroscopy, in order to understand how it unfolds and refolds during its transition through the 5-fold pore.  The sequential conformational shifts within the particle that allow this  transition to occur as the virion transits its entry pathway, exposing first its VP2 N-termini, then its VP1 N-termini and ultimately its DNA are being analyzed using X-ray crystallography and asymmetric cryo-electron microscopy, in a collaboration with Drs. Susan Hafenstein and Michael Rossmann at Purdue University.  Finally, we are using reverse genetics combined with differential real-time PCR, sub-cellular fractionation and in situ imaging techniques, to explore the roles of the VP1 N-terminal domain in the trans-cytosolic trafficking and nuclear import of MVM virions.   <br /> <br /><strong>Manipulating the oncoselectivity of parvoviruses in human tumor models</strong><br />   Many of the rodent parvoviruses will bind to and enter human cells with high efficiency, but fail to initiate gene expression, replicate their genomes, generate progeny or spread through the culture, unless the host cell is neoplastically transformed.  As a consequence, these viruses are promising candidates as oncolytic agents for cancer therapy, particularly in situations where other treatments have proven ineffective.  Our current efforts are directed toward understanding, at the molecular level, why cellular changes that accompany oncogenic transformation promote viral growth, and how we can use this knowledge to further improve the efficacy of the virus in tumor eradication.  Since tumorigenesis normally involves loss of genomic integrity, tumor cells carry many mutations that are secondary to those causing the transformed phenotype.  To avoid studying or selecting for viral traits that represent adaptations to such &ldquo;collateral&rdquo; transformed cell properties, we are using host cells that have been transformed in a stepwise fashion with activated oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor knock-downs.  Currently we are exploring the contribution of the viral capsid and initiating promoter to the discrimination between normal and transformed cells, using stepwise transformed human fibroblasts and melanocytes, the latter being a model for malignant melanoma.  These studies are directing strategies for selecting more oncotropic versions of these critical oncoselective elements, using gene shuffling and degenerate promoter library approaches.    <br /><br /><strong>Translational studies on a newly-discovered human bocavirus</strong><br />   Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a human parvovirus that was discovered in 2005 and shown to be present in a significant fraction of bronchioalveolar samples from children presenting in the clinic with respiratory tract infection.

Parvoviral induction of complete tumor regression has been achieved in several syngeneic transplantable tumor models in immunocompetent rodent hosts, and often results in immunization of the animal against subsequent transplantation of cells of the same tumor, even at high input numbers, suggesting that some aspect of parvovirus infection elicits a strong anti-tumor immune response.  This project utilizes a mouse melanoma model system to explore whether parvovirus-induced cell death proceeds via an immunogenic, rather than tolerogenic, pathway, by examining the expression of phagocytic engulfment signals on the infected cell surface, coupled with the secretion of soluble damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules, such as HMGB1 and Hsp72.</ins></p><ins class='diffins'>
</ins><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><ins class='diffins'>Characterizing the unique chromatin assembled during parvoviral DNA replication:</ins></em></strong><ins class='diffins'>  during the S-phase following infection, autonomous parvoviruses inveigle host cells to replicate the linear, single-stranded viral DNA chromosome, instead of the cellular genome.  Part of the virus&rsquo; replication strategy involves the elaboration of a unique form of chromatin, which ChIP analysis suggests incorporates both cellular histones and many copies of NS1, the major viral non-structural protein.  This project explores the replication of an otherwise wildtype viral genome rendered artificially devoid of NS1 binding sites throughout its entire NS1 gene, capsid gene and/or 3&rsquo; untranslated region.  2D gel electrophoresis and nuclease protection assays will be used to look for stalling or pausing of replication forks through the capsid region, and to characterize packaging intermediates generated by mutant, compared to wildtype, virus.</ins></p>

Her work has provided behavioral and biochemical evidence that drug-induced neuroadaptations in cortical and subcortical brain regions result in dysfunctional decision-making abilities and loss of impulse control that, in combination with enhancements of incentive motivation, may contribute to compulsive, habit-driven, behavior in addiction. This theory has received significant attention and has had a major impact on current work in drug addiction research ranging from basic molecular mechanisms, to neurophysiology, and to human neuropsychology and imaging studies. It is, consequently, a major research focus in the field of addiction biology. Her published work in this area has had far reaching impact and includes many â€œfirstsâ€, for example, showing drug-induced cognitive deficits in orbitofrontal cortex in monkeys as well as in rodent models. Most recently she has extended this work to examine the neurobiology of goal directed actions vs. habitual behavior. This paper was the first to demonstrate a selective modulation of behavior by sex chromosome genes, completely independent of gonadal hormone status.  Using a mouse model that segregates sex chromosomes (XX vs. XY) from gonadal phenotype (ovaries vs. testes), she found a sex difference in the rate of habit formation whereby XX mice show faster habit formation compared to XY mice, irrespective of hormonal â€˜sexâ€™ status.  These data provide new insight into the neurobiological bases of sex differences in the etiology of human habitual or compulsive psychopathologies, such as drug addiction.

Using a mouse model that segregates sex chromosomes (XX vs. XY) from gonadal phenotype (ovaries vs. testes), she found a sex difference in the rate of habit formation whereby XX mice show faster habit formation compared to XY mice, irrespective of hormonal â€˜sexâ€™ status.  These data provide new insight into the neurobiological bases of sex differences in the etiology of human habitual or compulsive psychopathologies, such as drug addiction.   Together these findings have also had a major influence because Dr. Taylorâ€™s work and emphasis has been on delineating cellular/molecular mechanisms the underlie complex psychological processes.

Her work has provided behavioral and biochemical evidence that drug-induced neuroadaptations in cortical and subcortical brain regions result in dysfunctional decision-making abilities and loss of impulse control that, in combination with enhancements of incentive motivation, may contribute to compulsive, habit-driven, behavior in addiction. This theory has received significant attention and has had a major impact on current work in drug addiction research ranging from basic molecular mechanisms, to neurophysiology, and to human neuropsychology and imaging studies.

This work is conceptualized within a social justice perspective, occurs within multiple social-ecological levels (such as the individual, the family, peers, the school, the neighborhood or community, and the broader culture), and generally takes place in a variety of community settings that involve mostly at risk, traumatized, or clinical populations. Examples of some of these population groups include: bereaved young adults; &ldquo;sandwiched generation&rdquo; women caregivers; children of mothers with serious mental illness; maltreated children or children in foster care; urban, low-income adolescents; and persons in recovery from mental illness or addiction. Some of my research involves randomized controlled trials and some involves evaluations of programs or services carried out by public agencies or community-based organizations. Most of this work has been collaborative and conducted in partnership with other investigators, community-based organizations, state and municipal agencies, and community stakeholders. In my evaluation research, I study the operations and effectiveness of programs and services designed for at risk, traumatized, or clinical populations. To the extent possible, my research is intended to inform professional practice, the design of new programs, the transformation of settings and communities, or the development of data-driven and effective policy. Below I summarize my scholarly work on resilience and research methodology, and describe its relationship to other scholarly areas, including: the prevention of adolescent substance use, positive youth development, adaptation and resilience promotion with various vulnerable target populations, culture and diversity, the use of data to inform practice and policy development, and meta-science. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span> <span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Resilience.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span> Resilience is characterized by normative development despite adverse circumstances. My colleagues and I have sought to identify risk and protective factors associated with resilience among vulnerable populations, and to promote resilience among at-risk groups. My early research examined risk processes among women who had primary caregiving responsibilities for a child as well as an elder family member, which led to a randomized trial of the effectiveness of mutual support for these &ldquo;sandwiched generation&rdquo; women. This trial was among the first to examine the health impacts of mutual support on the children of caregivers. In other studies, my colleagues and I have examined resilience processes among children of mothers with serious mental illnesses and bereaved young adults.

Next, we developed a school-based mentoring intervention for urban, low-income adolescents to prevent substance use and promote resilience.

Some of the work that my colleagues and I have done shows how various forms of bias influence causal inferences about external validity in community-based randomized trials. My colleagues and I have also introduced various methodological innovations in community research, such as the term &ldquo;panel accretion&rdquo; to describe participants who are added to a panel study after a prevention trial begins; a &ldquo;convergence index&rdquo; to depict the similarity of sibling risk within families; and a system-level approach to assessing service access within a system of care. More recently, we have extended this work to describe cultural influences, broadly defined, on community-based research.

										<li><p>My scholarly work has primarily focused on two areas: 1) the study of resilience among vulnerable populations; and, 2) evaluation research and community research methodology. This work is conceptualized within a social justice perspective, occurs within multiple social-ecological levels (such as the individual, the family, peers, the school, the neighborhood or community, and the broader culture), and generally takes place in a variety of community settings that involve mostly at risk, traumatized, or clinical populations. Examples of some of these population groups include: bereaved young adults; &ldquo;sandwiched generation&rdquo; women caregivers; children of mothers with serious mental illness; maltreated children or children in foster care; urban, low-income adolescents; and persons in recovery from mental illness or addiction. Some of my research involves randomized controlled trials and some involves evaluations of programs or services carried out by public agencies or community-based organizations. Most of this work has been collaborative and conducted in partnership with other investigators, community-based organizations, state and municipal agencies, and community stakeholders. In my evaluation research, I study the operations and effectiveness of programs and services designed for at risk, traumatized, or clinical populations. To the extent possible, my research is intended to inform professional practice, the design of new programs, the transformation of settings and communities, or the development of data-driven and effective policy. Below I summarize my scholarly work on resilience and research methodology, and describe its relationship to other scholarly areas, including: the prevention of adolescent substance use, positive youth development, adaptation and resilience promotion with various vulnerable target populations, culture and diversity, the use of data to inform practice and policy development, and meta-science. <br /><br /> <strong>Resilience.</strong> Resilience is characterized by normative development despite adverse circumstances. My colleagues and I have sought to identify risk and protective factors associated with resilience among vulnerable populations, and to promote resilience among at-risk groups. My early research examined risk processes among women who had primary caregiving responsibilities for a child as well as an elder family member, which led to a randomized trial of the effectiveness of mutual support for these &ldquo;sandwiched generation&rdquo; women. This trial was among the first to examine the health impacts of mutual support on the children of caregivers. In other studies, my colleagues and I have examined resilience processes among children of mothers with serious mental illnesses and bereaved young adults. More recently, we have studied risk and protective factors for various outcomes involving maltreated and foster care children in the child welfare system. <br /><br />My colleagues and I have also conducted trials of community-based programs among adolescent populations at-risk for substance use and other problem behaviors. Initially, we examined the effectiveness of teaching decision-making skills in school settings to urban, small-town adolescents and their parents in order to prevent adolescent substance use; we then adapted this intervention for use with urban, low-income adolescents in after-school settings by incorporating positive youth development principles and cultural heritage activities. Next, we developed a school-based mentoring intervention for urban, low-income adolescents to prevent substance use and promote resilience. All of these interventions were successful in preventing substance use. <br /><br />I have also been fortunate to collaborate with other investigators to examine the effectiveness of interventions that promote community adaptation for various clinical populations. These have included randomized controlled trials of community-based programs, such as crisis-respite services for persons with serious mental illness or peer support services for persons in recovery from serious mental illness, as well as large-scale studies of the effectiveness of statewide services, such as community support services for persons in recovery; system of care services for children with serious emotional disorders; and multi-systemic therapy for juvenile offenders and their families. <br /><br /><strong>Evaluation and community research methodology.</strong> For many years, I have had a scholarly interest in evaluation and community research methodology, and at times, this interest has led to research projects that overlap with my work on resilience. My interest in methodology stems from the challenge posed by the observation that human behavior is subject to multiple socio-ecological influences that operate simultaneously, thus making it difficult to determine causality. Some of the work that my colleagues and I have done shows how various forms of bias influence causal inferences about external validity in community-based randomized trials. My colleagues and I have also introduced various methodological innovations in community research, such as the term &ldquo;panel accretion&rdquo; to describe participants who are added to a panel study after a prevention trial begins; a &ldquo;convergence index&rdquo; to depict the similarity of sibling risk within families; and a system-level approach to assessing service access within a system of care. More recently, we have extended this work to describe cultural influences, broadly defined, on community-based research.

GANGLIA FUNCTION IN MICE<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>.  The basal ganglia, consisting of the
striatum (caudate-putamen) and related subcortical structures, have
historically been considered to have primarily motor functions; but it has
become increasingly clear that they are also involved in a variety of cognitive
and affective processes.  Disruption of normal basal ganglia function is
seen in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive
disorder, Tourette syndrome, and drug addiction.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    The striatum has been divided into distinct functional
regions, though both the anatomical subdivisions and the functions with which
they are associated remain approximate and subject to debate.  The ventral
striatum, consisting of the nucleus accumbens and related structures, has a
well-documented role in reward and reward-driven learning, and has been
extensively researched in the context of drug addiction.  The dorsal
striatum (caudate and putamen, in primates) is thought to have a role in the
formation of motor and cognitive patterns and in forms of implicit learning,
including the formation of habits.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    The Pittenger laboratory is focused on the better
understanding of the mechanisms of dorsal striatum-dependent habit-like
learning, and of the consequences of its perturbation in various
neuropsychiatric conditions.  We conduct our researches primarily in mice,
which allows us to take advantage of sophisticated reverse genetic techniques
to perturb the striatal circuitry in molecularly precise ways and to target
specific striatal subregions and neuronal subtypes.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL
BEHAVIORAL ASSAYS.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>  A challenge in this line of work is that
striatum-dependent learning processes have been less studied than those
depending on other brain regions, such as hippocampus, cerebellum, and
amygdala, and have barely been studied in mice at all prior to the last few
years.  A major thrust of our efforts has therefore been the establishment
and validation of behavioral assays of striatal function in mice.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>CREB IN
STRIATAL SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY AND STRIATUM-DEPENDENT LEARNING<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>.  Dr.
Pittengerâ€™s initial work in this direction began during his Ph.D. studies with
recent Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, with the production of transgenic mice
expressing a dominant-negative mutant of the ubiquitous transcription factor
CREB specifically in the striatum.  CREB has long been known to have a
conserved role in the establishment of long-lasting plasticity; for example,
Dr. Pittengerâ€™s earlier thesis work confirmed its role in the hippocampus in
the stabilization of spatial learning (Pittenger <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>et al<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>, <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>Neuron<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>, 2002).<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    However, the role of CREB-regulated processes in dorsal
striatum-dependent habit-like learning had not previously been directly
studied.  We found that inhibition of CREB function in the dorsal striatum
disrupts cortico-striatal synaptic plasticity and several striatum-dependent
learning tasks (Pittenger <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>et al<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>, <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>J Neurosci<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>, 2006).  This study
represented the first time that the detailed mechanisms of striatum-dependent
learning had been examined using genetic tools in mice.  It also
established a new paradigm (adapted from earlier work in rats) for the analysis
of such learning processes in mice, laying the methodological groundwork for
further analyses.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    <span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS
BETWEEN LEARNING SYSTEMS<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>.  More recent behavioral work in the
Pittenger laboratory has examined the interaction of dorsal striatum-dependent
learning with other types of learning and other circuits in the brain.  We
developed a novel cued water maze task for mice (again taking previous work in
rats as our starting point), and found that the animals could learn to navigate
using distinct strategies driven by either local or spatial cues.  Lesions
of the dorsal striatum disrupted cue-driven search, while lesions of the dorsal
hippocampus disrupted spatial navigation.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    The remarkable finding came
when we looked at interactions: hippocampal lesions not only left cued learning
intact, they enhanced it.  Conversely, striatal lesions not only left
spatial learning unimpaired, they made it better.  The same effect was see
in our transgenic mice, in which striatal CREB is inhibited and corticostriatal
plasticity is impaired: these animals have impaired cued learning but enhanced
spatial learning (Lee <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>et al<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>, <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>PNAS<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>, 2008).<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    This study was the first to document this sort of
bi-directional enhancement after discrete brain lesions.  We interpret the
counter-intuitive results in terms of the multiple memory systems theory of
learning.  This theory posits that the mammalian brain contains several
different learning systems, adapted for different types of environmental
contingencies.  For example, the hippocampus is adapted for the processing
of spatial or relational information, while the dorsal striatum is hypothesized
to be adapted for the gradual acquisition of discrete cue associations. 
Under normal circumstances they are activated in parallel; with training,
whichever system is best able to master the relevant environmental contingency
(e.g. to predict reward) comes to dominate.  But in circumstances where
two systems produce disparate behavioral outcomes they can destructively
interfere with one another, or â€˜competeâ€™; this is particularly likely early in
training, before differential reinforcement has led to the predominance of one
system.  We interpret the enhancement of the function subserved by one
system after manipulations of the other as evidence for the alleviation of such
competition.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>STRIATAL
SUBREGIONS<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>.  Our ongoing work in this direction seeks to refine our
understanding of the structures underlying cued and spatial learning and their
interaction.  The dorsal striatum is not a homogeneous structure;
different areas receive projections from functionally distinct regions of
cortex and are therefore likely to process different sorts of
information.  In particular, the dorsolateral striatum (the putamen, in
primates) receives projections from primary sensory and motor cortices, and
therefore is likely to be involved in acquisition of cue-driven learning such
as that we are seeing in the water maze task.  The dorsomedial striatum,
in contrast, receives input from association cortices and may have a more
general role.  Indeed, studies in rats suggest such a dissociation, and
our own preliminary data suggest that restricted lesions of the dorsomedial
striatum have very different effects from larger disruptions of the whole
dorsal striatum.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    We are addressing the question of functional
dissociation within the dorsal striatum in several ways.  First, we seek
to better define what is meant by the â€˜dorsomedial striatumâ€™ and â€˜dorsolateral
striatumâ€™ in this context by examining striatal activation by water maze
learning in an unbiased way; we have found the different tasks to produce
distinct patterns of striatal activation, enen though they share all sensory,
motor, and motivational characteristics.  Second, we are targeting lesions
to putative striatal subregions and examining the behavioral
consequences.  Finally, we are targeting disruptions of CREB-mediated
transcription to striatal subregions using recombinant adeno-associated viruses
(rAAV), to see whether disruption in a restricted subregion is sufficient to
recapitulate the effects we see when CREB is inhibited throughout the dorsal
striatum in our transgenic mice.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>NEW METHODOLOGIES FOR
PROBING AND PERTURBING STRIATAL FUNCTION<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>.  This latter project
highlights another theme in the Pittenger laboratoryâ€™s research portfolio, the
development of novel tools for precise manipulation of specific mechanisms and
cell populations in the dorsal striatum, and in other neural circuits. 
The production of transgenic mice allowed restriction of a molecular
manipulation to the dorsal striatum, but it does not suffice for more specific
targeting of manipulations to discrete subregions.  For that purpose we
are now using engineered rAAV vectors to deliver our CREB dominant negative
construct, and other gene products, into defined brain areas by stereotaxic
surgery.  A first-generation vector, which we are currently using, allows
expression of a CREB dominant negative in target brain regions of varying
size.  A second-generation vector, which is under development and working
well in vitro, permits the temporal regulation of the delivered gene, such that
it can be turned on and off; this will allow behavioral experimental designs
not possible with static manipulations, such as dissociating learning from
recall.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    Another major effort in the laboratory is the targeting of
defined striatal cell populations.  The striatum, like any other brain
region or structure, is not homogenous; it is made up of distinct populations
of principal cells and a number of different classes of interneurons. 
Different cell types are likely to make different contributions to striatal
function, and perturbation of one or another cell type may result in discrete
behavioral abnormalities or (in humans) patterns of psychopathology.  We
have developed a method, combining recombinant viruses with transgenic technologies,
to perturb defined cell populations, without disrupting similar cells elsewhere
in the brain or neighboring cells of different types.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>MODELING
PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>.  We are applying this technology to model
neuropsychiatric conditions affecting the striatum, especially Tourette
syndrome.  This represents a third focus of the laboratory.  Modeling
psychiatric disease in animals has proven enormously challenging, because
etiology is often obscure and symptomatology is often difficult to translate to
non-verbal species.  We believe that the development of valid models
hinges on a sufficient degree of understanding of pathophysiology to ensure
validity when translating to animals.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    Fortunately, studies at Yale and elsewhere are beginning to
produce such understanding in the case of Tourette syndrome. We are using
genetic methods to produce putative models of Tourette syndrome based both on
post-mortem findings (in collaboration with Flora Vaccarino) and on genetic
insights (in collaboration with Matt State).  These animals are then being
tested in a variety of behavioral assays to assess their recapitulation of
Tourette syndrome phenomenology, explore secondary and tertiary consequences of
the initial manipulations, and investigate the response to both established and
novel medications.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>A FOCUS ON

laboratory is also translational.  Dr. Pittenger is Director of the Yale
OCD Research Clinic, where he has found glutamate-modulating medications to be
of potential benefit in the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (a condition in which basal ganglia dysfunction is implicated). 
We are examining the behavioral and molecular effects of such glutamate-modulating
drugs in animals, to better understand their role in patients with this and
related conditions.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    As new animal models of
disorders of the basal ganglia, like OCD, become available, we hope to use this
translational approach to advance our understanding both of the normal role of
the basal ganglia in behavior and its perturbation in disease, and to develop
new generations of therapeutics for the psychiatric population.]</span>. Actual:<span style='color:red;']</span>[<span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>STUDIES OF BASAL

CREB specifically in the striatum.  CREB has long been known to have a
conserved role in the establishment of long-lasting plasticity; for example,
Dr. Pittenger’s earlier thesis work confirmed its role in the hippocampus in
the stabilization of spatial learning (Pittenger <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>et al<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>, <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>Neuron<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>, 2002).<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    However, the role of CREB-regulated processes in dorsal

manipulation to the dorsal striatum, but it does not suffice for more specific
targeting of manipulations to discrete subregions.  For that purpose we
are now using engineered rAAV vectors to deliver our CREB dominant negative
construct, and other gene products, into defined brain areas by stereotaxic
surgery.  A first-generation vector, which we are currently using, allows
expression of a CREB dominant negative in target brain regions of varying
size.  A second-generation vector, which is under development and working
well in vitro, permits the temporal regulation of the delivered gene, such that
it can be turned on and off; this will allow behavioral experimental designs
not possible with static manipulations, such as dissociating learning from
recall.<br>    Another major effort in the laboratory is the targeting of
defined striatal cell populations.  The striatum, like any other brain
region or structure, is not homogenous; it is made up of distinct populations
of principal cells and a number of different classes of interneurons. 
Different cell types are likely to make different contributions to striatal
function, and perturbation of one or another cell type may result in discrete
behavioral abnormalities or (in humans) patterns of psychopathology.  We
have developed a method, combining recombinant viruses with transgenic technologies,
to perturb defined cell populations, without disrupting similar cells elsewhere
in the brain or neighboring cells of different types.<br><br><strong>MODELING
PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE</strong>.  We are applying this technology to model
neuropsychiatric conditions affecting the striatum, especially Tourette
syndrome.  This represents a third focus of the laboratory.  Modeling
psychiatric disease in animals has proven enormously challenging, because
etiology is often obscure and symptomatology is often difficult to translate to
non-verbal species.  We believe that the development of valid models
hinges on a sufficient degree of understanding of pathophysiology to ensure
validity when translating to animals.<br>    Fortunately, studies at Yale and elsewhere are beginning to
produce such understanding in the case of Tourette syndrome. We are using
genetic methods to produce putative models of Tourette syndrome based both on
post-mortem findings (in collaboration with Flora Vaccarino) and on genetic
insights (in collaboration with Matt State).  These animals are then being
tested in a variety of behavioral assays to assess their recapitulation of
Tourette syndrome phenomenology, explore secondary and tertiary consequences of
the initial manipulations, and investigate the response to both established and
novel medications.<br><br><strong>A FOCUS ON
TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH: NEW MEDICATIONS FOR OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)</strong>.  The final focus of the Pittenger
laboratory is also translational.  Dr. Pittenger is Director of the Yale
OCD Research Clinic, where he has found glutamate-modulating medications to be
of potential benefit in the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (a condition in which basal ganglia dysfunction is implicated). 
We are examining the behavioral and molecular effects of such glutamate-modulating
drugs in animals, to better understand their role in patients with this and
related conditions.  <br>    As new animal models of
disorders of the basal ganglia, like OCD, become available, we hope to use this
translational approach to advance our understanding both of the normal role of
the basal ganglia in behavior and its perturbation in disease, and to develop
new generations of therapeutics for the psychiatric population.

										<li>										<strong>STUDIES OF BASAL
GANGLIA FUNCTION IN MICE</strong>.  The basal ganglia, consisting of the
striatum (caudate-putamen) and related subcortical structures, have
historically been considered to have primarily motor functions; but it has
become increasingly clear that they are also involved in a variety of cognitive
and affective processes.  Disruption of normal basal ganglia function is
seen in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive
disorder, Tourette syndrome, and drug addiction.<br>    The striatum has been divided into distinct functional
regions, though both the anatomical subdivisions and the functions with which
they are associated remain approximate and subject to debate.  The ventral
striatum, consisting of the nucleus accumbens and related structures, has a
well-documented role in reward and reward-driven learning, and has been
extensively researched in the context of drug addiction.  The dorsal
striatum (caudate and putamen, in primates) is thought to have a role in the
formation of motor and cognitive patterns and in forms of implicit learning,
including the formation of habits.<br>    The Pittenger laboratory is focused on the better
understanding of the mechanisms of dorsal striatum-dependent habit-like
learning, and of the consequences of its perturbation in various
neuropsychiatric conditions.  We conduct our researches primarily in mice,
which allows us to take advantage of sophisticated reverse genetic techniques
to perturb the striatal circuitry in molecularly precise ways and to target
specific striatal subregions and neuronal subtypes.<br><br><strong>DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL
BEHAVIORAL ASSAYS.</strong>  A challenge in this line of work is that
striatum-dependent learning processes have been less studied than those
depending on other brain regions, such as hippocampus, cerebellum, and
amygdala, and have barely been studied in mice at all prior to the last few
years.  A major thrust of our efforts has therefore been the establishment
and validation of behavioral assays of striatal function in mice.<br><br><strong>CREB IN
STRIATAL SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY AND STRIATUM-DEPENDENT LEARNING</strong>.  Dr.
Pittenger<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> initial work in this direction began during his Ph.D. studies with
recent Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, with the production of transgenic mice
expressing a dominant-negative mutant of the ubiquitous transcription factor
CREB specifically in the striatum.  CREB has long been known to have a
conserved role in the establishment of long-lasting plasticity; for example,
Dr. Pittenger<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> earlier thesis work confirmed its role in the hippocampus in
the stabilization of spatial learning (Pittenger <em>et al</em>, <em>Neuron</em>, 2002).<br>    However, the role of CREB-regulated processes in dorsal
striatum-dependent habit-like learning had not previously been directly
studied.  We found that inhibition of CREB function in the dorsal striatum
disrupts cortico-striatal synaptic plasticity and several striatum-dependent
learning tasks (Pittenger <em>et al</em>, <em>J Neurosci</em>, 2006).  This study
represented the first time that the detailed mechanisms of striatum-dependent
learning had been examined using genetic tools in mice.  It also
established a new paradigm (adapted from earlier work in rats) for the analysis
of such learning processes in mice, laying the methodological groundwork for
further analyses.<br><br>    <strong>COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS
BETWEEN LEARNING SYSTEMS</strong>.  More recent behavioral work in the
Pittenger laboratory has examined the interaction of dorsal striatum-dependent
learning with other types of learning and other circuits in the brain.  We
developed a novel cued water maze task for mice (again taking previous work in
rats as our starting point), and found that the animals could learn to navigate
using distinct strategies driven by either local or spatial cues.  Lesions
of the dorsal striatum disrupted cue-driven search, while lesions of the dorsal
hippocampus disrupted spatial navigation.<br>    The remarkable finding came
when we looked at interactions: hippocampal lesions not only left cued learning
intact, they enhanced it.  Conversely, striatal lesions not only left
spatial learning unimpaired, they made it better.  The same effect was see
in our transgenic mice, in which striatal CREB is inhibited and corticostriatal
plasticity is impaired: these animals have impaired cued learning but enhanced
spatial learning (Lee <em>et al</em>, <em>PNAS</em>, 2008).<br>    This study was the first to document this sort of
bi-directional enhancement after discrete brain lesions.  We interpret the
counter-intuitive results in terms of the multiple memory systems theory of
learning.  This theory posits that the mammalian brain contains several
different learning systems, adapted for different types of environmental
contingencies.  For example, the hippocampus is adapted for the processing
of spatial or relational information, while the dorsal striatum is hypothesized
to be adapted for the gradual acquisition of discrete cue associations. 
Under normal circumstances they are activated in parallel; with training,
whichever system is best able to master the relevant environmental contingency
(e.g. to predict reward) comes to dominate.  But in circumstances where
two systems produce disparate behavioral outcomes they can destructively
interfere with one another, or <del class='diffmod'>â€˜competeâ€™</del><ins class='diffmod'>‘compete’</ins>; this is particularly likely early in
training, before differential reinforcement has led to the predominance of one
system.  We interpret the enhancement of the function subserved by one
system after manipulations of the other as evidence for the alleviation of such
competition.<br><br><strong>STRIATAL
SUBREGIONS</strong>.  Our ongoing work in this direction seeks to refine our
understanding of the structures underlying cued and spatial learning and their
interaction.  The dorsal striatum is not a homogeneous structure;
different areas receive projections from functionally distinct regions of
cortex and are therefore likely to process different sorts of
information.  In particular, the dorsolateral striatum (the putamen, in
primates) receives projections from primary sensory and motor cortices, and
therefore is likely to be involved in acquisition of cue-driven learning such
as that we are seeing in the water maze task.  The dorsomedial striatum,
in contrast, receives input from association cortices and may have a more
general role.  Indeed, studies in rats suggest such a dissociation, and
our own preliminary data suggest that restricted lesions of the dorsomedial
striatum have very different effects from larger disruptions of the whole
dorsal striatum.<br>    We are addressing the question of functional
dissociation within the dorsal striatum in several ways.  First, we seek
to better define what is meant by the <del class='diffmod'>â€˜dorsomedial</del><ins class='diffmod'>‘dorsomedial</ins> striatum<del class='diffmod'>â€™</del><ins class='diffmod'>’</ins> and <del class='diffmod'>â€˜dorsolateral</del><ins class='diffmod'>‘dorsolateral</ins>
striatum<del class='diffmod'>â€™</del><ins class='diffmod'>’</ins> in this context by examining striatal activation by water maze
learning in an unbiased way; we have found the different tasks to produce
distinct patterns of striatal activation, enen though they share all sensory,
motor, and motivational characteristics.  Second, we are targeting lesions
to putative striatal subregions and examining the behavioral
consequences.  Finally, we are targeting disruptions of CREB-mediated
transcription to striatal subregions using recombinant adeno-associated viruses
(rAAV), to see whether disruption in a restricted subregion is sufficient to
recapitulate the effects we see when CREB is inhibited throughout the dorsal
striatum in our transgenic mice.<br><br><strong>NEW METHODOLOGIES FOR
PROBING AND PERTURBING STRIATAL FUNCTION</strong>.  This latter project
highlights another theme in the Pittenger laboratory<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> research portfolio, the
development of novel tools for precise manipulation of specific mechanisms and
cell populations in the dorsal striatum, and in other neural circuits. 
The production of transgenic mice allowed restriction of a molecular
manipulation to the dorsal striatum, but it does not suffice for more specific
targeting of manipulations to discrete subregions.  For that purpose we

RNA-rich, granular organelles, whose exact function remains
mysterious.  In </ins><em><ins class='diffins'>C.  elegans</ins></em><ins class='diffins'>, these organelles, called P
granules, are provided maternally and segregate with the P lineage
during the initial embryonic divisions.  All germ cells born from the P
lineage contain P granules (except mature sperm).  Several protein
components of P granules have been identified, but their contribution
to P granule function and germline viability remains unclear.  We have
identified two novel, related proteins that localize exclusively to
embyonic P granules.  They are not found in other cell compartments or
on P granules in larvae or adults.  These genes are called </ins><em><ins class='diffins'>meg-1</ins></em><ins class='diffins'> and </ins><em><ins class='diffins'>meg-2</ins></em><ins class='diffins'>
(maternal-effect germ cell-defective), and they are required for larval
germ cell proliferation and normal P granule morphology.  </ins><em><ins class='diffins'>meg-1</ins></em><ins class='diffins'> has genetic interactions with core components  of P granules that suggests that </ins><em><ins class='diffins'>meg-1</ins></em><ins class='diffins'> and </ins><em><ins class='diffins'>meg-2</ins></em><ins class='diffins'>
are required to regulate certain aspects of P granule function in the
early P blastomeres during the time that somatic and germ fates are
intermingled. Current efforts in the lab are directed toward defining
the exact function of MEG-1 and MEG-2 and dissecting how P granules
affect transcript stability in the early embryo.</ins></p>

Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>My scholarly work has two central areas of focus: one is the exploration of ethical and professional behavior in medicine, how to evaluate it, and encourage its flourishing. My goal has been to encourage residents to be aware of the personal, professional and systemic barriers to appropriate behavior, and through reflection and reaffirmation of important values and concerns, enhance their ability to meet their personal high ideals for professional behavior. The second focus of my work has been excellence in ambulatory medicine and dissemination of current, evidence-based updates for residency education and faculty development. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>My background in medical ethics has served me well in this setting and has allowed me to participate in fascinating and important conversations about how to support ethical and professional development not only at the student but resident level. Early in my career, I developed an interest in how to support ethical and professional behavior through attention to context and the clinical environment. As a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar, I further elucidated the nature of and factors that created ethical discomfort among medical residents in my primary fellowship project. This work has been a foundation of my ethics and professionalism teaching at Yale, and a contribution to the literature that had previously focused more on medical student ethical development and less on residency, arguably a distinct and separate stage of training. This more recent publication lead to my participation in the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation&rsquo;s Project on the Hidden Curriculum. We are current analyzing qualitative data from 12 focus groups at 3 medical institutions to explore the effect of transitions on the professional development of medical trainees, as well as patient care. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>My interest in articulating, establishing, and affecting the role of physicians and the pharmaceutical industry has led to my participation in two projects (including a systematic review of residency education) that have evaluated efforts to teach residents about these important issues of professional behavior.

										<li>										<strong>History
of Molecular Biology</strong><br>The early history of molecular biology is
embedded in the work of physicists who applied concepts from physics to
biological systems. One major aspect of this early work was the
development of the target theory. The detailed history of the origins
of the target theory has been reconstructed from the published
literature and from archival material. The next phase of this project
will examine the formation and influences of the American Phage Group.
This material will form some of the background against which the larger
history of molecular biology will be placed.

<br><strong><br>History of the Manchurian Plague, 1910-1911</strong><br>Beginning in October 1910,
a major epidemic of pneumonic plague swept through Manchuria and by the
spring of 1911 had killed between 45,000-60,000 people. The plague and
its aftermath were to play an important role in the geopolitical events
leading up to the Japanese takeover of Manchuria and complex causes of
World War II. The concentrated force of this epidemic, its near 100
percent mortality rate, and its occurrence in a region of international
competition and diplomatic struggle all contributed to the importance
and interest in the Manchurian plague. The "Manchurian Question" was of
immense interest in the United States: America had just enjoyed its
first taste of successful international leadership upon Roosevelt's
brokering the peace treaty of 1905 that ended the Russo-Japanese war
over territorial rights in Manchuria. Russia, on the other hand was
intent on retaining what she could of her centuries-old foothold in
east Asia. Japan, modernizing after the Meiji restoration in 1868, was
experiencing international ambitions and expansionism in Korea and
Manchuria, in its own version of "manifest destiny." China, under the
yoke of war reparations owed to both the Western Powers and to Japan as
the result of the ill- fated Boxer Rebellion in 1895, was struggling
with its first efforts at modernization while still governed by the
decaying, and increasingly ineffective Qing dynasty. This project aims
to elucidate the multiple uses which was made of the plague to exhibit
the importance of epidemic disease in geopolitics.<P><ins class='diffins'>Study of the geopolitics of disease using the Manchurian Plague of 1910-1911 as a case study; History of the American Phage Group; Integration of history and philosophy in the study and teaching of science as a process.</ins></P>

agonist maintenance treatment through investigations of alternatives to
methadone for maintenance treatment (e.g., buprenorphine), investigations of
adjunctive behavioral (e.g., behavioral drug and HIV risk reduction counseling,
BDRC) and pharmacological (e.g., disulfiram) treatments, and developing
integrated treatments for co-occurring disorders (co-occurring stimulant abuse
or co-occurring chronic pain) for opioid dependent individuals; 2. improving
the accessibility and effectiveness of opioid dependence treatment by
integrating it in office-based and primary care settings; and 3. expanding
opioid dependence treatment and clinical research in international settings
(with current projects in Malaysia,
Iran, and China).  My work on buprenorphine maintenance

efficacy of buprenorphine and methadone for patients with co-occurring cocaine
and opioid dependence.  Subsequent
studies evaluated adjunctive behavioral and pharmacological treatments to
improve the effectiveness of buprenorphine maintenance treatment for patients
with co-occurring cocaine and opioid dependence and also investigated the
effectiveness of buprenorphine maintenance treatment in office-based and

chronic pain among opioid dependent patients treated in primary care settings,
and the potential advantages of using buprenorphine to treat co-occurring
chronic pain and opioid dependence (POD) in these settings led to our current

In addition we demonstrated that estradiol and progesterone not only affect osmotic regulation of AVP, but also affect body fluid distribution across the compartments (interstitial, intra- and extra-cellular, plasma) and may have important implications for the development of edema in women.<br><br>Most importantly, in order to deal with challenges associated with studying reproductive hormone effects on physiological systems, we developed a model to study effects of reproductive hormones on physiological systems in young women.  In this model we <del class='diffmod'>â€œmedically</del><ins class='diffmod'>“medically</ins> oophorectomize<del class='diffmod'>â€</del><ins class='diffmod'>”</ins> young women by transiently suppressing gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) with an agonist (leuprolide acetate) or antagonist (ganirelix acetate).  Both of these drugs suppress GnRH and therefore suppress both estrogens and progesterone.  <br><br>While the women are suppressed, we add-back controlled levels of estradiol and progesterone to test the hypothesis of interest.  This protocol is particularly useful because it isolates estradiol effects from those of progesterone in young women.  Other methods of studying estradiol effects in young women (such as pregnancy, oral contraceptives, menstrual cycle phase) can only indirectly infer estradiol-related effects because other physiological changes are taking place simultaneously.  This model provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect of the chosen sex hormone on a variety of system.			 <br><br>Our research continues to examine the effects of reproductive hormones (now including testosterone) on thermoregulation and fluid regulation in young, healthy women and in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).  We have recently demonstrated that combined sodium loss with water retention is a characteristic of women at risk for Exercise Associated Hyponatremia (EAH).  These studies have demonstrated that in women at risk for this potentially fatal syndrome, the primary cause of EAH is more closely related to overall fluid retention concomitant with sodium losses.  <br><br>Our studies have also demonstrated that obese women with PCOS have compromised thermoregulation compared to their healthy obese counterparts, which may be related to their consistent elevations in testosterone.			 <br><br>My current grant addresses the impact of female reproductive hormones on blood pressure regulation in women at risk for orthostatic intolerance.  Regularly occurring orthostatic intolerance can be debilitating and is much more common in young women relative to men, children or older women.  Our studies will determine the roles of estradiol and progesterone in this syndrome, and will also explore the peripheral mechanisms involved.  <br><br>To study mechanisms related to orthostatic intolerance in young women we use microneurography to examine the extent to which sympathetic nervous system activity mediates sex hormone effects on orthostatic tolerance, and laser Doppler flowmetry combined with skin microdialysis to examine mechanisms controlling the peripheral circulation.  <br><br>Our recent studies have demonstrated that adrenergic responses are shifted to the right in women with low orthostatic tolerance, suggested reduced vasoconstriction in response to adrenergic stimulation compared to women with high orthostatic tolerance.  Moreover our studies have demonstrated that progesterone enhances vasoconstriction in response to adrenergic stimulation only in women with high orthostatic tolerance.  We are just beginning studies examining endothelial function in the skin microvasculature in women with PCOS<ins class='diffins'>.R01 HL71159 Title: Estrogen and progesterone effects on orthostatic intolerance </ins><br><ins class='diffins'>P.I</ins>.<ins class='diffins'> Nina Stachenfeld </ins><br><br><ins class='diffins'>R21 HL093450 Title:  Compromised microcirculation in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome P.I.

Dr. Sherwinâ€™s laboratory has provided strong evidence that the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) plays a critical glucose-sensing role. Experiments in rodents exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia indicated that defective hormone secretion induced by antecedent iatrogenic hypoglycemia in diabetes could be explained by a failure of the VMH to activate counterregulatory responses. His laboratory is now focused on the molecular mechanisms used by the VMH to sense glucose, an area of importance not only for glucose counteregulation, but also for the regulation of feeding. He is testing the intriguing hypothesis that the VMH senses glucose via mechanisms similar to those used by the beta cell and that GABA neurotransmission is involved. This concept is supported by studies showing that like the beta cell local glucose availability regulates KATP channels in the VMH, which in turn modulate the release of counterregulatory hormones. A link with local VHM GABA neurotransmission is supported by data showing the activation state of VMH KATP channels modulates GABA levels in the VMH interstitial fluid. Thus, GABA release by beta cell-like neurons in the VMH could play an important role in modulating hormonal responses to hypoglycemia. The lab has also generated interesting data suggesting that this is not be the whole story. Some VMH glucose sensing neurons appear to use the enzyme AMP-K, which serves as a â€œfuel gaugeâ€ in a variety of cells in peripheral tissues, such as muscle. Reduction of AMP-K gene expression (bilateral VMH injection of AMP-K siRNA) suppresses glucose counterregulation. The lab is also examining the mechanism mediating defective glucose counterregulation after intensive treatment of diabetes., the major cause of severe hypoglycemia in patients. These studies suggest that multiple adaptive mechanisms may be involved including: upregulation of VMH CRFR2 recectors , increased VMH GABA tone and AMP-Kinase activity.

										<li>We study two related human tumor viruses: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is associated with lymphomas and carcinomas; and Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which is associated with Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma and lymphomas that occur in patients with AIDS. Both viruses establish â€œlatent statesâ€ in host cells, during which only a limited number of viral genes are expressed. We have discovered multifunctional virally encoded transcription factors and replication proteins, ZEBRA and Rta in EBV and KSHV ORF50, which mediate a switch between latency and the lytic cycle. Our lab studies the control of ZEBRA, Rta and ORF50 expression and their mechanisms of action and interaction. We are interested in the basis of viral specificity of these activators. We also investigate how the immune system detects and regulates the latent and lytic cycle program of EBV in B cells.

Based on a risk and protective factor model, these investigations assessed whether an intervention, Coping with Work and Family Stress, aimed at increasing individualsâ€™ use of active coping strategies and social support, reducing stressors and avoidance coping, and enhancing effective stress management approaches led to the prevention or reduction of alcohol and drug use and psychological symptoms. Essential components of the research included: 1) identifying risk and protective factors that are predictive of substance use and psychological symptoms and that can be targeted in subsequent interventions; and 2) assessing the effectiveness of randomized controlled interventions implemented in the workplace. Significant effects of these efficacy trials have been shown in reducing work, family, and work-family stressors, increasing social support from supervisors and coworkers, enhancing the use active coping and decreasing the use of avoidance coping strategies, and in reducing alcohol consumption, smoking and other substance use, and psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatic complaints. Based on these research findings, Coping with Work and Family Stress was designated by SAMHSA in 2003 as a Model Prevention Program and, more recently (2007), was listed as an evidence-based program by the National Registry of Effective Programs and Practices (NREPP). Building on this phase of research, effectiveness trials are currently underway with new populations and settings, most notably with medical residents in training at university medical schools. In addition to this ongoing research, the program is now in a stage of active dissemination nationally and internationally. Future intervention research will involve: (1) efforts to change risk and protective factors at multiple levels of the organization (individual employee, work group or department, overall organization) in order to achieve even greater effect sizes, (2) to test the efficacy of modified, but related, interventions designed specifically for family caregivers in the workplace, in one instance, and, in another, for women in community settings at risk for HIV/AIDS and substance abuse disorders, (3) to disseminate science-based workplace interventions to military personnel and their families; and 4) to collaborate on a study of the effects of changes in Time and Place Management (TPM) policies (i.e. workplace flexibility) on employee health, well being, and productivity in a large U.S. corporation

										<li>										There is increasing interest in the development of workplace preventive interventions as a means of reaching large segments of the adult population to address the potentially adverse effects of work, family, work-family, and other stressors. The spectrum of documented stress-related problems among workers is extensive, ranging from psychological symptoms, including depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints to substance abuse to physical health problems such as heart disease, hypertension, and obesity.

of metabolism. We are looking at collaborative treatment protocols,
diagnostic strategies, and process and outcomes of newborn screening.
The data implicate a false positive newborn screening test as a
significant cause of anxiety in new parents, suggesting that prompt
assessment and confirmatory testing are crucial in the evaluation of
abnormal newborn screening results.
<br><br>We are one 25 worldwide research sites conducting a clinical trial
to study the effectiveness of a tetrahydrobiopterin, (BH4) a new
investigational drug to lower the levels of phenylalanine (Phe) in the
blood of persons diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU). We hope to learn
whether or not this investigational drug will be effective to lessen
some of the dietary restrictions necessary to lower the concentration
of phenylalanine in the blood to acceptable treatment levels. This
study is being done in the General Clinical Research Center at Yale New
Haven Hospital in New Haven.
We are collaborators in a multi-center consortium working to develop
a clinical registry of patients with all urea cycle disorders. This
effort is part of an NIH-sponsored Rare Diseases Clinical Research
Network (RDCRN). An important aspect of this effort is a longitudinal
study of outcome in urea cycle disorders. The goal of this study is to
identify all of the patients in the North America and determine
clinical outcomes, efficacy of treatment and the importance of timing
of diagnosis.<ul><ins class='diffins'>

Our conclusion from this study was <del class='diffmod'>â€“</del><ins class='diffmod'>–</ins> higher order association regions (like hippocampus, thalamus and cingulate gyrus) since they receive their input from multisynaptic pathways are much more sensitive to 0.25 MAC sevoflurane compared to the unimodal association areas.  <br><br>2)    Subsequently we studied the effect 0.25 and 0.5 MAC sevoflurane on auditory activation and memory activation.   0.25 MAC sevoflurane attenuated activation of the auditory cortex while 0.5 MAC sevoflurane exerted profound effects on the auditory cortex.  This is of clinical relevance because auditory activation closely correlates with midlatency auditory evoked response which in turn correlates with amnesia under anesthesia.  <br><br>3)    When memory was activated (subjects heard a story presented over the headphones) both levels of sevoflurane anesthesia profoundly decreased the memory score in the subjects.  fMRI imaging revealed decrease in activity in the thalamus and pre frontal cortex.  However activation of the hippocampus persisted at 0.5 MAC sevoflurane. Clinically all the subjects were asleep and had no memory of any events at 0.5 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia.  <br><br>4)    The effect of 0.5 MAC sevoflurane on functional activity was studied with BOLD imaging.  Low frequency oscillations in BOLD signals were compared in the awake and anesthesia state.  Though subjects were asleep connectivity persisted in the thalamus at 0.5 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia.<br><br>We are presently studying the effect of somatosensory and auditory activation under 0.5 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia.

This research has led to the development of two prototype agents that following activation generate a second reactive species, 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine, abbreviated 90CE, with broad spectrum potent activity against transplanted murine and human tumors.  The first series of synthetic compounds yielding a clinical candidate were 2-aminocarbonyl-1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazines which undergo activation by base catalyzed decomposition to yield 90CE.  The selected candidate agent, onriginâ„¢ (formally called cloretazine), which chloroethylates the O-6 position of guanine in DNA and ultimately forms DNA G-C cross-links, has shown considerable activity in elderly patients with poor risk de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) for which no standard therapy is available.  Onrigin as a single agent has produced an objective response rate (CR, complete remission + CRp, all of the criteria for a CR with platelets less than 100,000/Âµl) of 34% these patients, with modest systemic toxicity.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    A second group of 1,2-bis(sulfonyl)hydraznes that generates 90CE is exemplified by 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-2-[[(1-4-nitrophenyl)ethoxy]carbonyl]hydrazine (KS119), which undergoes a different activation mechanism (bioreduction) to generate 90CE; this agent and several analogs thereof have been developed in our laboratory to target the reductive enzymatic potential of hypoxic regions within solid tumors.  We have pioneered the concept, introduced in the early 1970â€™s, that hypoxic areas in tumors are sites of vulnerability in that the environment of these cells promotes selective reductive activation directly in solid tumors, creating an exploitable difference between normal cells in body tissues, which are usually well oxygenated, and hypoxic neoplastic cells.  We have developed several lead prodrug compounds that selectively generate cytotoxic products that destroy hypoxic tumor cells, which are usually quite resistant to therapeutic intervention, as well as employing the hypoxic fraction to generate agents that circumvent the major resistance mechanism to agents targeting the O-6 position of guanine in DNA.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>b.

This action results in tumor reistance to the chloroethylating and methylating agents described above and, in experimental systems, a direct relationship exists between AGT activity and the degree of resistance to O-6 guanine targeting agents.  AGT is also present in varying amounts in normal tissue, thereby protecting normal tissue to agents such as onrigin; however, the concentration of AGT in tumors often is significantly higher than in corresponding normal tissue.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>    One of the most potent known inhibitors of AGT is O<span style='color:red;']</span>[sup]</span>6<span style='color:red;']</span>[/sup]</span>-benzylguanine (O<span style='color:red;']</span>[sup]</span>6<span style='color:red;']</span>[/sup]</span>-BG); this agent reacts with AGT to form S-benzylcysteine in the active site of the protein.

Non-toxic doses of systemic O<span style='color:red;']</span>[sup]</span>6<span style='color:red;']</span>[/sup]</span>-BG have been shown in patients to deplete the AGT content of tumors and enhance the antineoplastic action of the nitrosourea carmustine.  A similar depletion of AGT in normal tissue is produced by O<span style='color:red;']</span>[sup]</span>6<span style='color:red;']</span>[/sup]</span>-BG; this action also sensitizes host tissue to the cytodestructive action of carmustine, necessitating an 80% decrease in the dose of carmustine because of excessive myelosuppression.  The large decrease in the dosage of the nitrosourea results in an ineffective level of carmustine.  To circumvent this problem, we are currently designing prodrug inhibitors of AGT activated by the reductive potential of hypoxic tumor cells in an effort to selectively deplete AGT in solid tumors relative to normal tissue, such that sensitivity to O-6 DNA guanine targeting agents will be selectively cytotoxic to solid tumors.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>c.    An additional series of agents that we have developed is exemplified by the potential drug, triapine, the most potent known inhibitor of the important enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR); triapine has also shown clinical activity against acute myelogenous leukemia.  RNR catalyzes a rate-limiting reaction in which ribonucleoside diphosphates are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, the precursors of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) required for DNA synthesis and repair.  Mammalian RNR consists of two non-identical homodimers, R1 and either R2 or p53R2, which are considered to be involved in DNA replication and repair, respectively.  The R2 subunit of RNR maintains dNTP pools for DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle and p53R2 supplies dNTPs for DNA repair when DNA damage occurs.  Since 50% of human cancers contain mutated or deleted p53 it was not clear how malignant cells that lacked inducible p53R2 supplied sufficient dNTPs for DNA repair.  To study this issue, we employed HCT-116 p53(-/-) cells which we developed from p53(+/+) HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells and demonstrated an accumulation of the R2 protein in these cells in response to triapine, cisplatin and doxorubicin.  R2-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to decrease the level of the R2 protein and caused a marked increase in sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin, as well as to the RNR inhibitor triapine.  These findings and others provided evidence that R2-RNR was capable of supplying dNTPs for the repair of DNA damage in p53 deficient tumor cells.  We are currently studying the role of the S phase checkpoint in facilitating DNA damage repair by R2-RNR in p53 deficient ovarian carcinoma cells damaged by cisplatin and other platinum-containing drugs, as well as by triapine, which preferentially depletes dATP levels.  The mechanism involved in the preferential depletion of dATP is currently unknown.]</span>.

Non-toxic doses of systemic O<span style='color:red;']</span>[sup]</span>6<span style='color:red;']</span>[/sup]</span>-BG have been shown in patients to deplete the AGT content of tumors and enhance the antineoplastic action of the nitrosourea carmustine.

An additional series of agents that we have developed is exemplified by the potential drug, triapine, the most potent known inhibitor of the important enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR); triapine has also shown clinical activity against acute myelogenous leukemia.  RNR catalyzes a rate-limiting reaction in which ribonucleoside diphosphates are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, the precursors of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) required for DNA synthesis and repair.  Mammalian RNR consists of two non-identical homodimers, R1 and either R2 or p53R2, which are considered to be involved in DNA replication and repair, respectively.  The R2 subunit of RNR maintains dNTP pools for DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle and p53R2 supplies dNTPs for DNA repair when DNA damage occurs.  Since 50% of human cancers contain mutated or deleted p53 it was not clear how malignant cells that lacked inducible p53R2 supplied sufficient dNTPs for DNA repair.  To study this issue, we employed HCT-116 p53(-/-) cells which we developed from p53(+/+) HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells and demonstrated an accumulation of the R2 protein in these cells in response to triapine, cisplatin and doxorubicin.  R2-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to decrease the level of the R2 protein and caused a marked increase in sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin, as well as to the RNR inhibitor triapine.  These findings and others provided evidence that R2-RNR was capable of supplying dNTPs for the repair of DNA damage in p53 deficient tumor cells.  We are currently studying the role of the S phase checkpoint in facilitating DNA damage repair by R2-RNR in p53 deficient ovarian carcinoma cells damaged by cisplatin and other platinum-containing drugs, as well as by triapine, which preferentially depletes dATP levels.  The mechanism involved in the preferential depletion of dATP is currently unknown.Current projects we are working on are: <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[ol]</span>

										<li>The emphasis of our research is being placed upon the following: (a) the most intense research ongoing in the laboratory involves the design of a new class of antineoplastic agents, the 1,2-bis(sulfonyl)hydrazines that function as alkylating agent prodrugs which target the O-6 position of guanine in DNA (a prodrug is an inactive form, which can be converted by neoplastic cells to an active therapeutic form). This research has led to the development of two prototype agents that following activation generate a second reactive species, 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine, abbreviated 90CE, with broad spectrum potent activity against transplanted murine and human tumors.  The first series of synthetic compounds yielding a clinical candidate were 2-aminocarbonyl-1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazines which undergo activation by base catalyzed decomposition to yield 90CE.  The selected candidate agent, onriginâ„¢ (formally called cloretazine), which chloroethylates the O-6 position of guanine in DNA and ultimately forms DNA G-C cross-links, has shown considerable activity in elderly patients with poor risk de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) for which no standard therapy is available.  Onrigin as a single agent has produced an objective response rate (CR, complete remission + CRp, all of the criteria for a CR with platelets less than 100,000/Âµl) of 34% these patients, with modest systemic toxicity.<br>    A second group of 1,2-bis(sulfonyl)hydraznes that generates 90CE is exemplified by 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-2-[[(1-4-nitrophenyl)ethoxy]carbonyl]hydrazine (KS119), which undergoes a different activation mechanism (bioreduction) to generate 90CE; this agent and several analogs thereof have been developed in our laboratory to target the reductive enzymatic potential of hypoxic regions within solid tumors.  We have pioneered the concept, introduced in the early 1970â€™s, that hypoxic areas in tumors are sites of vulnerability in that the environment of these cells promotes selective reductive activation directly in solid tumors, creating an exploitable difference between normal cells in body tissues, which are usually well oxygenated, and hypoxic neoplastic cells.  We have developed several lead prodrug compounds that selectively generate cytotoxic products that destroy hypoxic tumor cells, which are usually quite resistant to therapeutic intervention, as well as employing the hypoxic fraction to generate agents that circumvent the major resistance mechanism to agents targeting the O-6 position of guanine in DNA.<br><br>b.    O<sup>6</sup>-Alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), a repair protein that catalyzes the transfer of both alkyl and methyl groups from the O-6 position of DNA guanine generated from chloroethylating agents such as onrigin, KS119, and carmustine (BCNU), as well as temozolomide and other tumor methylating agents to cysteine 145 of the AGT molecule, thereby inactivating AGT and restoring the O-6 position of guanine to its native form.  This action results in tumor reistance to the chloroethylating and methylating agents described above and, in experimental systems, a direct relationship exists between AGT activity and the degree of resistance to O-6 guanine targeting agents.  AGT is also present in varying amounts in normal tissue, thereby protecting normal tissue to agents such as onrigin; however, the concentration of AGT in tumors often is significantly higher than in corresponding normal tissue.  <br>    One of the most potent known inhibitors of AGT is O<sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine (O<sup>6</sup>-BG); this agent reacts with AGT to form S-benzylcysteine in the active site of the protein.

Many retinopathies involve a disruption of the epithelium's interactions with the neural retina or its uncontrolled proliferation. Surgical interventions limit the progression of disease, but fail to restore function. Although encouraging progress has been made with RPE transplantation, its effectiveness is limited to the earliest stages of disease when patients would be reluctant to have surgery.  Our goal is to expand that window of opportunity by understanding the interactions of the RPE with its neighbors, the choroid and the neural portion of the retina. Our early studies with chick RPE demonstrated that: 1) As the neural retina matures, it secretes factors that induce the RPE to form the outer blood-retinal barrier by decreasing the permeability of RPE junctions. 2) At the RPE/neural retina interface, extracellular matrix or cell-cell interactions regulate the distribution of certain integrins. These integrins are redistributed when the neural retina and its extracellular matrix mature. 3) Initially, diffusible factors produced by the neural retina maintain the apical polarity of the Na,K-ATPase. These retinal factors differ from those that decrease the permeability of the monolayer, and may act indirectly through effects on the structure of the apical microvilli. 4) Gene array studies demonstrate that 40% of the RPE transcriptome changes in parallel with retinal development.  Retinal secretions regulate many of these changes.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Our current research asks whether the chick studies are relevant to human biology. Surprisingly, we found that the tight junctions of human RPE differ significantly from those of non-primate vertebrates -- surprising because tight junctions serve a conserved function. Tight junctions are an integral part of any blood-tissue barrier, because they regulate diffusion across the paracellular spaces of an epithelial monolayer. Tight junctions form a network of anastomosing strands that encircles each cell and binds it to its neighbors in the monolayer. They regulate the permeability and selectivity of the paracellular path and are matched with the ion channels and transporters that regulate the transcellular movement of solutes. Claudins are a family of at least 24 proteins that determine the properties of tight junctions and each epithelium expresses a subset that reflects the physiology of the organ. Human RPE expresses a different set of claudins that non-primate vertebrates which implies differences in retinal physiology.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>In both cultures of human fetal RPE (hfRPE) and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived RPE, we found that we could make the barrier function more in vivo-like by using a serum free medium that we call SFM-1. Studies of the transcriptome demonstrate that SFM-1 affects many genes and that adaptation of the cultures to SFM-1 furthers the maturation of hESC-RPE.  This was demonstrated in two cells, H1 and H9. Examining function and the transcriptome leads us to believe that even after SFM-1, hESC-RPE remains less mature than hfRPE isolated from 16 week-gestation fetal eyes.  The study identifies 25 marker genes that can be used to monitor the maturation of RPE that we predict will occur when hESC-RPE is co-cultured with hESC-derived retinal precursors (RPC). <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>To test this hypothesis, RPE and RPC need to be culture in the same media.  It appears that SFM-1 furthers the maturation of RPC so that co-culture is feasible.  We have found that a woven scaffold of polycaprolactone provides a way to culture RPC as a flat sheet that can be layered atop a sheet of RPE.  Preliminary data indicate that gene expression is altered in both the RPE and RPC layers following co-culture.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>I believe this co-culture model will provide a superior platform to explore the efficacy of drugs that might treat retinal degenerations or improve the efficacy of transplantation. Further, the model itself may prove to be a suitable tissue for transplantation into patients with advanced retinal degeneration.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>

The questions have become what to teach, when to teach it and how to teach it in less time. The problem is especially acute for anatomy. Even though the classical anatomy course is a large component of medical school, residency programs believe their residents come ill-prepared. Further, the pool of qualified instructors is shrinking. To address these issues of content, efficiency and instructors, I investigated what students need, how they learn and how instructors teach.  I call the resulting method &ldquo;Clinically-Engaged Anatomy&rdquo;. Clinically-engaged anatomy engages students in professional behaviors to learn the anatomy that prepares them for clerkships. Students learn how to draw inferences from skillful observation to form testable hypotheses, test them and teach others about the process.  The coursework requires students to develop the teamwork skills that characterize modern medical practice.  The clinical cases that drive the curriculum are cases commonly encountered in Yale affiliated hospitals. Students study the anatomy that underlies the patient&rsquo;s history, physical exam, imaging studies and medical or surgical resolution.  The cadaver becomes a simulated patient whereby anatomy is explored by performing surgical procedures.  This approach fosters integration of anatomy with clinical training and has attracted large numbers of clinic faculty to participate.  Despite a 30% reduction in course hours, we demonstrated that students recall more when they enter clerkships.  Clinically-engaged anatomy merges advanced web resources with laboratory dissection. My &ldquo;Anatomy Clinic&rdquo; website attracts more than 17,000 non-Yale page viewings per year from around the world and is used in Great Britain for their &ldquo;Basic Training Programme for Anatomy Professionals&rdquo;. The anesthesiology and otolaryngology residency training programs adapted these methods to their laboratory sessions. Therefore, clinically engaged anatomy has identified important anatomy to teach, conveys that knowledge effectively in less time, and attracts a large number of faculty who would not participate in the old course. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span> <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span> Current research asks how to train the next generation of anatomy instructors.  Very few training programs remain for anatomists.  Most institutions require instructors to maintain competitive biomedical research programs, which means mastering a discipline that is unrelated to anatomy. The goal is to develop a training program for upper-tier postdoctoral fellows that has minimal impact on their biomedical research training. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>A second project investigates how clinical students incorporate interactive computer activities into their daily work and how that information might guide curricular development.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>

										<li><p><strong>Biomedical Research</strong><br /> The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays a central role in retinal physiology by forming the outer blood-retinal barrier and supporting the function of the photoreceptors. Many retinopathies involve a disruption of the epithelium's interactions with the neural retina or its uncontrolled proliferation. Surgical interventions limit the progression of disease, but fail to restore function. Although encouraging progress has been made with RPE transplantation, its effectiveness is limited to the earliest stages of disease when patients would be reluctant to have surgery.  Our goal is to expand that window of opportunity by understanding the interactions of the RPE with its neighbors, the choroid and the neural portion of the retina. Our early studies with chick RPE demonstrated that: 1) As the neural retina matures, it secretes factors that induce the RPE to form the outer blood-retinal barrier by decreasing the permeability of RPE junctions. 2) At the RPE/neural retina interface, extracellular matrix or cell-cell interactions regulate the distribution of certain integrins. These integrins are redistributed when the neural retina and its extracellular matrix mature. 3) Initially, diffusible factors produced by the neural retina maintain the apical polarity of the Na,K-ATPase. These retinal factors differ from those that decrease the permeability of the monolayer, and may act indirectly through effects on the structure of the apical microvilli. 4) Gene array studies demonstrate that 40% of the RPE transcriptome changes in parallel with retinal development.  Retinal secretions regulate many of these changes.</p>
<p>Our current research asks whether the chick studies are relevant to human biology. Surprisingly, we found that the tight junctions of human RPE differ significantly from those of non-primate vertebrates -- surprising because tight junctions serve a conserved function. Tight junctions are an integral part of any blood-tissue barrier, because they regulate diffusion across the paracellular spaces of an epithelial monolayer. Tight junctions form a network of anastomosing strands that encircles each cell and binds it to its neighbors in the monolayer. They regulate the permeability and selectivity of the paracellular path and are matched with the ion channels and transporters that regulate the transcellular movement of solutes. Claudins are a family of at least 24 proteins that determine the properties of tight junctions and each epithelium expresses a subset that reflects the physiology of the organ. Human RPE expresses a different set of claudins that non-primate vertebrates which implies differences in retinal physiology.</p>

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Title A Novel Approach to Measuring the Impact of Surgery in Craniosynostosis using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) Background Much debate surrounds whether children with non-syndromic craniosynostosis (NSC) sustain neurodevelopmental deficits. This controversy surrounding surgery in patients with NSC has initiated many studies involving neuropsychological measurements attempting to characterize the impact of surgical intervention on mental function.  However, early studies employing developmental quotients to test infants fail to adequately predict the impact of surgery on neurodevelopment. Unlike these primitive measures, studies utilizing event-related potentials (ERPs), based on cerebral electrical activity, in infants have been shown to be predictive of future outcomes. Objectives This study addresses previous shortcomings by using more sensitive neuropsychological measures in patients with NSC undergoing surgical correction. Furthermore, the study allows us to identify which infants with NSC are at risk of future abnormal language development and neurocognitive deficits. Moreover, ERPs can potentially serve as a standardized measure to assess surgical intervention.   Methods Infants with NSC were identified at the Yale Craniofacial clinic prior to surgery.  These patients underwent pre-operative testing using ERPs and will be tested post-operatively using the same technique.  Their results will be compared to age and gender matched controls.   Results Thus far, fifteen patients have subjected to the above protocol.  Once their post-operative testing is complete, they will be compared to control groups.     Conclusions If the results show that there is a significant difference between the way infants with craniosynostosis process speech sounds as compared to controls, this will provide evidence that surgical intervention is not merely a cosmetic procedure, but rather one necessary to prevent the impairment of neurodevelopment.

Once a rare condition, it has become a prevalent diagnosis since the early 1990s, concurrent with the American Academy of Pediatricsâ€™ recommendation for supine sleep to reduce Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Traditionally, physicians have regarded positional plagiocephaly as a benign condition with no neurodevelopmental sequelae, but recent research has suggested some evidence to the contrary. These studies have relied on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) for their assessment. While BSID is the most commonly-employed developmental assessment tool in infancy, it is a poor predictor of long-term intellectual function, and may not be sensitive enough to detect very subtle developmental delays. Unlike BSID, event-related potentials (ERPs, cerebral electrical responses to stimuli) have been shown to be predictive of future cognitive outcomes by other research teams. However, ERPs have never been used to study neurodevelopment in plagiocephaly.   Objectives: This study seeks to establish baseline cortical ERPs for infants with positional plagiocephaly and determine if a difference exists between infants with the diagnosis and non-afflicted controls. As a secondary aim, we plan to investigate the effects of skull-molding helmet therapy on auditory ERPs.   Methods: Infants with positional plagiocephaly are being identified during consultation at the Yale Craniofacial clinic, and at the Cranial Technologies, Inc. office in Madison, CT. These infants will undergo two ERP sessions: one at baseline, and a second one after 3 months of skull-molding helmet therapy or physical therapy.   Results: Pending.   Conclusions: Neurodevelopment in positional plagiocephaly remains a debated topic. If the results of this study show a significant difference between infants with the diagnosis and non-affected controls in terms of auditory ERPs, they would provide evidence against the notion that plagiocephaly is an entirely benign condition. We will investigate whether the severity of deformation can be correlated with ERP differences. Additionally, if differences do exist between affected infants and controls, we will investigate whether helmet therapy and/or physical therapy can ameliorate them.   References: 1.

This controversy surrounding surgery in patients with NSC has initiated many studies involving neuropsychological measurements attempting to characterize the impact of surgical intervention on mental function.  However, early studies employing developmental quotients to test infants fail to adequately predict the impact of surgery on neurodevelopment.

Moreover, ERPs can potentially serve as a standardized measure to assess surgical intervention.   Methods Infants with NSC were identified at the Yale Craniofacial clinic prior to surgery.  These patients underwent pre-operative testing using ERPs and will be tested post-operatively using the same technique.  Their results will be compared to age and gender matched controls.

Molecular imaging provides a unique opportunity to link vascular and molecular biology and imaging, ultimately leading to the development of novel imaging approaches, both for research and clinical diagnostics. The ultimate goal of research in my laboratory is to develop novel imaging approaches to detect the molecular pathobiology of the vessel wall in vivo. Our comprehensive approach includes several components. Through basic vascular biology research we identify relevant molecular processes and potential targets for imaging (and therapeutics). Next, we use the state of the art technology to develop novel tracers targeted at relevant molecular markers, and establish molecular vascular imaging protocols in animal models of human disease. Finally, we exploit these techniques to further advance vascular biology and clinical research. We have made significant progress towards achieving these goals in the past few years. Specifically, we have focused on vascular remodeling, as the prototypic pathological vascular process shared by many vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, graft arteriosclerosis, post-angioplasty restenosis, and aneurysm formation. Our federally funded studies of the pathophysiology of vascular remodeling in graft arteriosclerosis, performed under the umbrella of the Interdepartmental Program in Vascular Biology and Transplantation at Yale have led to the identification novel molecular markers, including a neuropilin-like protein, ESDN, as a potential target for diagnosis and therapy of vascular remodeling. We have demonstrated that ESDN is upregulated in vascular remodeling, and have defined its function as regulator of vascular cell proliferation in vivo. We are currently in the process of defining other aspects of ESDN function, including its role in growth factor and integrin signaling pathways, and identification of ESDN ligands. In molecular imaging arena, we have identified and validated avÃŸ3 integrin activation as a target for imaging the proliferative process in vascular remodeling, and have demonstrated the suitability of a?ÃŸ3-targeted tracers for imaging graft arteriosclerosis. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, as a key regulator of vascular remodeling, was targeted for in vivo imaging of injury-induced vascular remodeling and aneurysm formation using high resolution microSPECT imaging in conjunction with CT angiography for anatomical localization. We are currently in the process of optimizing the technical aspects of in vivo microSPECT/CT imaging to improve visualization and quantitation of molecular targets. In parallel, we have developed a novel â€œtracer designâ€ concept for in vivo applications and have been involved in the development of a novel intravascular detection system which combines scintigraphy with high resolution optical coherence tomography imaging.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[p style="margin-left: 27pt;"]</span>1.<span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span> Finding effective pharmacotherapies for individuals with alcohol dependence and comorbid psychiatric disorders.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> Although there is a large body of literature evaluating medications for the treatment of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, there are no established pharmacotherapies for individuals with comorbid psychiatric illnesses. Nevertheless, patients with substance dependence and comorbid mental disorders constitute the majority of patients in clinical settings, and the presence of comorbid mental disorders confers a poorer prognosis. Further, individuals with comorbid mental diseases have been systematically excluded from most efficacy studies of potential pharmacotherapies and more research is needed in this patient population. In fact, there is some evidence that patients with comorbid disorders may be less likely to get the treatment they need, particularly in mental health clinics. This research attempts to answer clinically relevant questions about efficacy, effectiveness and pharmacologic use in dually diagnosed individuals in order to better inform the development of treatments. This work has included a utilization studies about the use of naltrexone in alcohol dependent veterans; effectiveness studies such as a large effectiveness study with 254 veterans across 3 VA sites evaluating the use of naltrexone and disulfiram alone and in combination in a &ldquo;real world&rdquo; clinical setting. The results suggested that medications to treat alcoholism are safe and effective in these patients and more effective than no medication. Interestingly, there was no advantage to combination treatment. Individuals with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and those with psychosis did particularly well with medications to treat alcoholism.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p style="margin-left: 27pt;"]</span>In one of the first controlled studies to evaluate naltrexone for individuals with alcohol dependence and serious psychiatric disorder, patients with schizophrenia and alcohol dependence were randomized to naltrexone or placebo for a 12-week clinical trial. Naltrexone-treated patients had better alcohol related outcomes than placebo-treated patients. However, since naltrexone did not improve symptoms of psychosis or cognitive effects, further studies focused on treatments that might effectively treat symptoms of both disorders. Using administrative data, one study found that atypical neuroleptics are associated with no better outcomes than typical neuroleptics for substance misuse in schizophrenic patients. In a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; treatment study evaluating a glutamatergic agent, a Stanley foundation-funded clinical trial was conducted using glycine as a treatment of both alcohol misuse and symptoms of schizophrenia. Preliminary results support previous research that glycine is effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but not alcohol consumption. It should be noted that the final data analysis is not yet complete. More recently and after the FDA approved acamprosate for the treatment of alcoholism, a study was funded and is ongoing evaluating acamprosate&rsquo;s efficacy in patients with comorbid schizophrenia.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p style="margin-left: 27pt;"]</span>Individuals with PTSD have some of the highest rates of comorbid alcohol dependence and this is an important clinical issue,particularly at the VA.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>The significance of understanding
the relationship between GABA levels and cortical excitability.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>

Increased
cortical excitability is a hallmark of several human epileptic syndromes,
facilitating the spread of the seizure in the localization related epilepsies
and as a final common pathway for some of the primary generalized and myoclonic
epilepsies. Photosensitive epilepsy is the most common of the
stimulus-triggered (reflex) epilepsies, and there is considerable evidence,
developed primarily in animal models, that it is associated with impairments in
GABAergic inhibition, possibly secondary to alterations in GABA metabolism.
GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter and has a crucial role in
regulating cortical excitability. The concentration of GABA in both the
vesicular and cytosolic pools may have an important influence on GABAergic
inhibition. Our development of non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS) based measurements of cellular GABA in human cerebral cortex allowed us
to study GABA metabolism in human epilepsy. Our studies found profound
decreases in the level of cortical GABA in many patients with complex partial
seizures (CPS) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Our preliminary studies
suggest that GABA synthesis rates are decreased in patients with low GABA in
functional occipital cortex remote from the ictal onset zone. We found that, light-deprivation,
a condition that enhances excitability in the visual cortex, decreases GABA
levels in non-epileptic subjects in parallel with increased excitability measured
with paired-pulse stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation. These
results support an important role for cortical GABA level on cortical
excitability thereby facilitating the spread of seizure discharges from the
ictal onset zone to involve more normal functional brain. The primary goal is
to better understand the mechanisms by which GABA levels influence cortical
excitability, and the role of altered GABA levels in the etiology and
pathogenesis of epilepsy. Our primary general hypothesis is that reduced
cellular GABA levels result in an increase in cortical excitability through
decreased GABA release.

 

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>The significance of the relationship
between GABA metabolism and cortical excitability.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>

There is a
renewed awareness of the interaction between metabolism and excitability as the
relationships between different aspects of neuronal-glial neurotransmitter
cycling are established. In order to fully understand the physiologic
consequences on GABAergic inhibition of altering neurotransmitter cycling, our approach
was to start at the final step and work backwards. We used a variety of
physiologic and analytic methods to examine the consequences of glutamic acid
decarboxylase (GAD) inhibition on network excitability in the rat hippocampus. We
used field and intracellular recordings from the CA1 region of rat hippocampal
slices to determine the physiological effects of blocking GABA synthesis with
the convulsant, 3-mercaptoproprionic acid (MPA). We measured the rate of
synthesis of GABA and glutamate in slices using 2-13C-glucose as a label source
and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The primary goal was to
establish whether GAD inhibition alone was sufficient to induce network
hyperexcitability in an isolated preparation comparable to that seen with GABA
receptor inhibition. The key findings were that inhibition of GABA synthesis
via GAD only produces hyperexcitability following repetitive stimulation,
demonstrating a pronounced use dependence when studied both intra and
extracellularly. This is consistent with the data showing that the regulation
of IPSC amplitudes and of GABA release can be regulated by glutamine
availability in use-dependent fashion. In addition, our data with NO-711, which
blocks neuronal GABA uptake, indicated that under baseline conditions, neuronal
GABA uptake does not provide a significant degree of GABA that is available for
release under resting conditions, but does once frank hyperexcitability has
been produced by repetitive stimulation. Despite this clear disinhibition, we
were unable to observe seizure-like activity comparable to that seen with GABAA
receptor blockade until basal excitability was increased with elevated extracellular
potassium concentrations. Finally, our data demonstrated that there is no
significant change in the size of the GABA pool, even under conditions where
synchronized activity is present. However, as expected, GAD inhibition with MPA
significantly decreased the amount of newly formed GABA. These biochemical data
demonstrated that full blown network excitability is seen only with a
combination of &gt;70% decrease in newly synthesized GABA with a concomitant
moderate elevation in neuronal excitability. Thus, these data are comparable to
those in circuit modeling studies showing that GABAergic inhibition is highly
context-dependent.

 

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>Understanding the role of
homocarnosine in modulating human cerebral excitability.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> 

One aspect
of GABA biochemistry that has not received significant attention is the role of
GABA-containing compounds. One such compound is homocarnosine, a dipeptide
formed from histidine and GABA.  The role
of homocarnosine in the human brain is poorly understood. Homocarnosine has
been proposed as an inhibitory neuromodulator, which is hydrolyzed into GABA
and histidine in the extracellular fluid (ECF), thereby increasing GABAergic
activity. Consistent with this proposal, studies of refractory human epilepsy
using vigabatrin show that CSF homocarnosine concentrations are significantly
higher in patients whose seizure control improved than in those who failed to
benefit. Free GABA concentrations were the same. Our own observational studies
of human epilepsy suggest that increased cortical levels of intracellular
homocarnosine appear to be associated with decreased cortical excitability. Low
intracellular homocarnosine and GABA levels, measured in the occipital lobe
using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), are associated with frequent
complex partial seizures in patients treated with valproate or lamotrigine. Patients
with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy with excellent seizure control and treated
with the same drugs usually have high homocarnosine levels, but very low
intracellular GABA levels. What is unknown is whether higher levels of intracellular
homocarnosine are a characteristic of patients with primary epilepsies, perhaps
compensating for the low intracellular GABA levels and contributing to better
seizure control by decreasing cortical excitability. 

 

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>Topiramate, gabapentin and
levetiracetam are three new drugs that increase cortical homocarnosine
concentrations<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>. The
mechanisms through which these drugs increase human homocarnosine levels are
unknown. Unlike vigabatrin, none of these three drugs alter intracellular GABA
concentrations in rodent models Topiramate and gabapentin increase human
cortical GABA levels within two hours of the first dose and homocarnosine
levels rise after one day (with topiramate) to one week (with gabapentin) of
daily use. Levetiracetam was studied only after two weeks of treatment. Our
studies using three antiepileptic drugs show that patients with refractory

Mechanistic
studies have been carried out in whole animal and cell culture models, which

extracellular glutamate concentrations were considerably higher in patients
with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE) than in patients without this pathology (non-MTLE),
despite the 60â€“80% neuronal loss and doubling of glial density in the sclerotic
hippocampus. Surprisingly, a considerable (35â€“40%) loss of glutamine
synthetase protein and activity was demonstrated in astrocytes of the epileptogenic
hippocampus resected from
patients with MTLE. Isotopic tracer (13C-glucose) studies during epilepsy
surgery suggested that the accumulation and impaired clearance of glutamate in
MTLE is due to a slowing of the glutamateâ€“glutamine cycle metabolism in the
sclerotic hippocampus compared with the non-gliotic epileptogenic hippocampus. Based
on these data we hypothesize that elevated extracellular glutamate is a
consequence of impaired glial function due to both decreased rates of glial
uptake and/or metabolism. The isotopic enrichment of microdialysis (extracellular)
glutamine was higher for probes with nearly normal glutamate after infusion of
labeled substrates, which suggests the rate of glutamine synthesis, thus
glutamate detoxification, is lower in those areas of the brain with above
normal extracellular glutamate. The data obtained with an infusion of
13C-glucose or 13C-acetate on different days in the same subjects were the
same, which increased our confidence in the findings. The variation among
multiple probes in the same patient reflected regional variation in glutamine

therefore, our data suggested glial dysfunction in regions with above normal
extracellular glutamate concentrations.

Increased
cortical excitability is a hallmark of several human epileptic syndromes,
facilitating the spread of the seizure in the localization related epilepsies
and as a final common pathway for some of the primary generalized and myoclonic
epilepsies. Photosensitive epilepsy is the most common of the
stimulus-triggered (reflex) epilepsies, and there is considerable evidence,
developed primarily in animal models, that it is associated with impairments in
GABAergic inhibition, possibly secondary to alterations in GABA metabolism.
GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter and has a crucial role in
regulating cortical excitability. The concentration of GABA in both the
vesicular and cytosolic pools may have an important influence on GABAergic
inhibition. Our development of non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS) based measurements of cellular GABA in human cerebral cortex allowed us
to study GABA metabolism in human epilepsy. Our studies found profound
decreases in the level of cortical GABA in many patients with complex partial
seizures (CPS) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Our preliminary studies
suggest that GABA synthesis rates are decreased in patients with low GABA in
functional occipital cortex remote from the ictal onset zone. We found that, light-deprivation,
a condition that enhances excitability in the visual cortex, decreases GABA
levels in non-epileptic subjects in parallel with increased excitability measured
with paired-pulse stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation. These
results support an important role for cortical GABA level on cortical
excitability thereby facilitating the spread of seizure discharges from the
ictal onset zone to involve more normal functional brain. The primary goal is
to better understand the mechanisms by which GABA levels influence cortical
excitability, and the role of altered GABA levels in the etiology and
pathogenesis of epilepsy. Our primary general hypothesis is that reduced
cellular GABA levels result in an increase in cortical excitability through
decreased GABA release.

There is a
renewed awareness of the interaction between metabolism and excitability as the
relationships between different aspects of neuronal-glial neurotransmitter
cycling are established. In order to fully understand the physiologic
consequences on GABAergic inhibition of altering neurotransmitter cycling, our approach
was to start at the final step and work backwards. We used a variety of
physiologic and analytic methods to examine the consequences of glutamic acid
decarboxylase (GAD) inhibition on network excitability in the rat hippocampus. We
used field and intracellular recordings from the CA1 region of rat hippocampal
slices to determine the physiological effects of blocking GABA synthesis with
the convulsant, 3-mercaptoproprionic acid (MPA). We measured the rate of
synthesis of GABA and glutamate in slices using 2-13C-glucose as a label source
and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The primary goal was to
establish whether GAD inhibition alone was sufficient to induce network
hyperexcitability in an isolated preparation comparable to that seen with GABA
receptor inhibition. The key findings were that inhibition of GABA synthesis
via GAD only produces hyperexcitability following repetitive stimulation,
demonstrating a pronounced use dependence when studied both intra and
extracellularly. This is consistent with the data showing that the regulation
of IPSC amplitudes and of GABA release can be regulated by glutamine
availability in use-dependent fashion. In addition, our data with NO-711, which
blocks neuronal GABA uptake, indicated that under baseline conditions, neuronal
GABA uptake does not provide a significant degree of GABA that is available for
release under resting conditions, but does once frank hyperexcitability has
been produced by repetitive stimulation. Despite this clear disinhibition, we
were unable to observe seizure-like activity comparable to that seen with GABAA
receptor blockade until basal excitability was increased with elevated extracellular
potassium concentrations. Finally, our data demonstrated that there is no
significant change in the size of the GABA pool, even under conditions where
synchronized activity is present. However, as expected, GAD inhibition with MPA
significantly decreased the amount of newly formed GABA. These biochemical data
demonstrated that full blown network excitability is seen only with a
combination of &gt;70% decrease in newly synthesized GABA with a concomitant
moderate elevation in neuronal excitability. Thus, these data are comparable to
those in circuit modeling studies showing that GABAergic inhibition is highly
context-dependent.

catabolism. Taken as a whole these findings suggest, but do not prove, that
homocarnosine may decrease cortical excitability. 

 

<br><br><em>Homocarnosine appears to directly
decrease neuronal excitability of the human hippocampus.</em>

Mechanistic
studies have been carried out in whole animal and cell culture models, which
may not apply to humans because of the very low endogenous levels of
homocarnosine present in non-primate models. However, under conditions when
GABA is elevated, abundant homocarnosine is found in the rodent brain and CSF,
demonstrating that it can be synthesized de novo in the rodent.  Moreover, biochemical studies showed that
homocarnosine blocks GABA uptake into synaptosomes, suggesting that homocarnosine
has the potential to be an endogenous modulator of GABAergic function.  Our preliminary data using hippocampal slices
incubated in ACSF indicate that homocarnosine decreases neuronal excitability
in both rat and human hippocampus. We studied the effects of bath-applied
homocarnosine using electrophysiological recording techniques in the CA1 region
of rat hippocampal slices. We found that both homocarnosine and GABA shifted
the input-output relationship for evoked synaptic responses rightward and thus
was inhibitory. GABA and homocarnosine did not have additive effects,
suggesting a common mechanism of action. However, in intracellular recordings,
homocarnosine had no significant effects on the membrane potential and slightly
decreased the input resistance of the cells. Therefore, the dipeptide is not a
direct GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist. 

 

<br><br><em>An excess of extracellular glutamate
in the sclerotic hippocampus may be one of the key molecular causes of seizures
and brain damage in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</em>. Research by the Yale Epilepsy Clinical
Research group revealed that several important characteristics of the
epileptogenic human hippocampus include: above normal interictal extracellular
glutamate levels and enhanced glutamate release during spontaneous seizures
with abnormally slow post-ictal glutamate clearance. Paradoxically, interictal
extracellular glutamate concentrations were considerably higher in patients
with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE) than in patients without this pathology (non-MTLE),
despite the 60<del class='diffmod'>â€“80</del><ins class='diffmod'>–80</ins>% neuronal loss and doubling of glial density in the sclerotic
hippocampus. Surprisingly, a considerable (35<del class='diffmod'>â€“40</del><ins class='diffmod'>–40</ins>%) loss of glutamine
synthetase protein and activity was demonstrated in astrocytes of the epileptogenic
hippocampus resected from
patients with MTLE. Isotopic tracer (13C-glucose) studies during epilepsy
surgery suggested that the accumulation and impaired clearance of glutamate in
MTLE is due to a slowing of the glutamate<del class='diffmod'>â€“glutamine</del><ins class='diffmod'>–glutamine</ins> cycle metabolism in the
sclerotic hippocampus compared with the non-gliotic epileptogenic hippocampus. Based
on these data we hypothesize that elevated extracellular glutamate is a
consequence of impaired glial function due to both decreased rates of glial
uptake and/or metabolism. The isotopic enrichment of microdialysis (extracellular)
glutamine was higher for probes with nearly normal glutamate after infusion of
labeled substrates, which suggests the rate of glutamine synthesis, thus
glutamate detoxification, is lower in those areas of the brain with above
normal extracellular glutamate. The data obtained with an infusion of
13C-glucose or 13C-acetate on different days in the same subjects were the
same, which increased our confidence in the findings. The variation among
multiple probes in the same patient reflected regional variation in glutamine
synthesis and extracellular glutamate. Glutamine synthesis is limited to glia;
therefore, our data suggested glial dysfunction in regions with above normal
extracellular glutamate concentrations.<del class='diffmod'>

we are interested in the interhomolog interactions that occur during meiotic

meiotic division.  Important events
include homologous chromosome pairing, assembly of the synaptonemal complex
(SC), genetic recombination, and the formation of chiasmata. 

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>SC Proteins

<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>The SC is an elaborate proteinaceous
structure that assembles along the lengths of paired chromosomes during meiotic
prophase.  The Zip1 protein is a major
building block of the complex, where it serves as a bridge between the cores of
homologous chromosomes. 

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>A complex of proteins, called the synapsis
initiation complex (SIC), promotes the polymerization of Zip1 along
chromosomes. Components of this complex
include Zip2, Zip3 and Zip4.  In the <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>zip2 <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>and <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>zip4 <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>mutants, there is a complete failure of SC formation; in
contrast, a subset of synapsis initiation events does occur in the absence of the
Zip3 protein.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Recent studies have revealed novel
and unexpected functions for the Zip1 protein. 
In addition to its role as a structural component of the SC, Zip1 couples
chromosomes at their centromeres, represses crossing over near centromeres, and
promotes the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes.  Furthermore, Zip1â€™s special affinity for
centromeres defines these chromosomal regions as the earliest sites of synapsis
initiation.  Importantly, synapsis
initiation at centromeres is subject to special regulatory mechanisms that
prevent SC formation in the absence of meiotic recombination.
<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Zip1 Promotes Centromere Coupling<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Studies of the <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>spo11 <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>mutant,
which fails to initiate meiotic recombination or make SC, revealed an
unexpected role for the Zip1 protein.  In
the <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>spo11 <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>mutant, Zip1 localizes to foci on chromosomes, and these foci
coincide with centromeres.  Furthermore,
there are 16 foci per nucleus, representing 16 centromere "couples".  (A diploid yeast cell contains 32
chromosomes.)  In the <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>spo11 <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>mutant, coupling occurs predominantly between
the centromeres of nonhomologous chromosomes and is dependent on Zip1 and
independent of SICs.
<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>In wild-type cells, centromeres are
coupled from the earliest stages of meiotic prophase.  Prior to the initiation of SC formation, most
centromere couples involve nonhomologous chromosomes, but couples become
increasingly homologous as meiosis progresses. 
Thus, centromere couples must switch partners until the centromeres of
homologous chromosomes become coupled to each other.  We propose that centromere coupling
facilitates homolog pairing by holding two chromosomes together in a stable
configuration while homology is being assessed. 

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Zip1 Promotes Synapsis Initiation at Centromeres

<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Centromeres also play a role in
synapsis initiation.  At an early stage
in synapsis, when short linear stretches of Zip1 are first observed, about 80
percent of these regions of Zip1 staining are associated with centromeres.  Furthermore, although SICs are not found at
centromeres in <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>spo11 <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>nuclei, they are
found â€“ transiently â€“ at centromeres in wild type.  Thus, at early times in meiotic prophase,
most synapsis initiates at centromeres.  As
meiosis progresses, synapsis initiation at noncentromeric locations makes an
increasingly important contribution. 

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Studies of synapsis initiation at
centromeres have revealed a number of unexpected features of the synapsis
process.  First, synapsis is often
unidirectional, with Zip1 extending outward in only one direction from the
centromere.  Second, SICs are not fixed
in location; instead, they move at the leading edge of Zip1 polymerization.  These observations contrast with the
traditional view that SICs remain fixed in position and synapsis extends
outward in both directions from each SIC. 

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>It remains to be determined whether
synapsis initiation at noncentromeric locations is mechanistically similar to
synapsis initiation at centromeres, with respect to directionality and SIC
movement.  There is at least one
important difference between the two categories of synapsis initiation.  Synapsis initiation at centromeres is
independent of the Zip3 protein, whereas synapsis initiation at noncentromeric
locations requires Zip3.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Zip1 couples the centromeres of
nonhomologous chromosomes in a <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>spo11
<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>mutant and at early stages of meiotic prophase in wild type.  What prevents Zip1 from polymerizing along
the lengths of chromosomes under these conditions?   Synapsis
can take place between nonhomologous chromosomes under certain conditions, so
there must be a regulatory mechanism that normally prevents SC formation until
homologs are paired and recombination is initiated.  To characterize this regulatory network, we
looked for mutations that would allow extensive Zip1 polymerization in a <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>spo11 <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>mutant background.  We found that a mutation in the <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>FPR3 <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>gene, in conjunction with a
mutation in the <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>ZIP3 <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span>gene, allows
synapsis to occur even when recombination is not initiated.  Most of the synapsis that takes place in the <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>spo11 fpr3 zip3<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span> triple mutant involves
nonhomologous chromosomes, and almost all synapsis initiates at centromeres.
Surprisingly, the synapsis that occurs in the absence of the Fpr3 and Zip3
proteins is independent of Zip2, which previously has been shown to be
absolutely required for SC formation.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Taken together, these data suggest
that Fpr3 and Zip3 act in parallel and redundant pathways to prevent synapsis
in the absence of double-strand breaks. 
The Zip2 protein may function specifically to overcome the inhibition
imposed by Zip3 and Fpr3.  We postulate
that Fpr3 and Zip3 act by modifying Zip1 and/or other SC proteins.  Zip3 is a SUMO ligase; Fpr3 is a proline
isomerase.  

It is surprising that Zip3 performs

different functions at different locations. 
Zip3 inhibits synapsis at centromeres, whereas it promotes synapsis at
noncentromeric locations.   <br><br><strong>Zip1 Represses Crossing Over Near Centromeres
<br></strong><br>Meiotic recombination events,
specifically crossovers, are nonrandomly distributed along chromosomes.  One aspect of this nonrandomness is that
crossing over is repressed near centromeres. 
We have measured crossing over on a genome-wide basis using DNA microarrays
to monitor the segregation of ~8,000 polymorphisms.  These results reveal a striking (~10 fold)
decrease in crossing in the 10-kbp intervals on both sides of the centromere,
as predicted by genetic studies.   Furthermore, the centromeric repression of
crossing over is abolished by a <em>zip1
</em>null mutation.  The <em>zip1 </em>mutation also increases the rate of gene conversion in
centromere-proximal intervals, but it does not affect the frequency of meiotic
double-strand breaks.  Thus, Zip1 most
likely affects crossing over near centromeres by promoting interactions between
sister chromatids at the expense of interhomolog interactions.  

<br><br>Crossovers that occur too close to
centromeres cause chromosomes to missegregate in meiosis.  Thus, Zip1 may help to ensure proper
chromosome segregation by preventing centromere-proximal crossovers.  

<br><br><strong>Zip1 Promotes Distributive Disjunction

</strong><br><br>Crossovers
promote the correct segregation of chromosomes at the meiosis I division by
promoting the formation of chromatin bridges called chiasmata.  However, if one or a small number of
chromosome pairs fail to crossover, there is a backup system that facilitates
their proper segregation.  In wild-type
cells, the rate of nondisjuction for nonexchange chromosomes is ~10%.  This rate is elevated two to three fold by a <em>zip1 </em>mutation, suggesting a role for
Zip1 in promoting the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes.  The effect of <em>zip1 </em>on nonexchange chromosome segregation is not due indirectly to
its reduced level of crossing over and a consequent increase in the number of
nonexchange chromosomes: an <em>msh4</em>
mutation decreases crossing over to the same extent as Zip1 but does not
increase the rate with which nonexchange chromosomes missegregate.  Furthermore, cytological data indicate that
the Zip1 protein holds nonexchange chromosomes together at their centromeres
after all other chromosomes are paired and synapsed with homologous partners.

The research in our
computational biology and bionformatics laboratory involves analysis of
genomics and proteomics experiments. This includes computational analysis of
output from high-throughput datasets generated from experiments involving
melanoma, breast cancer, hematopoeisis, cell cycle genomics, and
protein-protein interactions. The central focus of our earlier studies was to
reveal functional and regulatory gene modules using genome-wide data generated
in various "Omics" experiments and auxiliary information from
genomics databases.  We addressed issues of normalization and artifacts in
microarrays. Subsequently, we developed a novel spectral method for
bi-directional clustering of cancer microarray data to reveal regulatory gene
modules. The lab has also focused on extracting meaningful biological
information from experimental systems by assessing the co-expression of genes
regulated by various transcription factors, evaluating pathway expression and
building genetic networks based on functionality rather than pure
expression.  This approach is a step forward in identifying genes in
regulatory networks that are disrupted by mutations of tumor suppressors and
oncogenes and could shed light on the process of malignant
transformation.  Our research also involves the integration of sequence
information with genome-wide transcriptome and epigenome profiles. This
analysis has allowed us and our collaborators to reveal non-unique sequence
recognition motifs of transcription factors in an in vivo context and to
predict combinatorial regulation partners of transcription factors. Moreover,
this approach has allowed us to find spatial organization of transcription
factor binding events, as well as their relationships with other epigenomic factors.

The research in our
computational biology and bionformatics laboratory involves analysis of
genomics and proteomics experiments. This includes computational analysis of
output from high-throughput datasets generated from experiments involving
melanoma, breast cancer, hematopoeisis, cell cycle genomics, and
protein-protein interactions. The central focus of our earlier studies was to
reveal functional and regulatory gene modules using genome-wide data generated
in various "Omics" experiments and auxiliary information from
genomics databases.  We addressed issues of normalization and artifacts in
microarrays. Subsequently, we developed a novel spectral method for
bi-directional clustering of cancer microarray data to reveal regulatory gene
modules. The lab has also focused on extracting meaningful biological
information from experimental systems by assessing the co-expression of genes
regulated by various transcription factors, evaluating pathway expression and
building genetic networks based on functionality rather than pure
expression.  This approach is a step forward in identifying genes in
regulatory networks that are disrupted by mutations of tumor suppressors and
oncogenes and could shed light on the process of malignant
transformation.  Our research also involves the integration of sequence
information with genome-wide transcriptome and epigenome profiles. This
analysis has allowed us and our collaborators to reveal non-unique sequence
recognition motifs of transcription factors in an in vivo context and to
predict combinatorial regulation partners of transcription factors. Moreover,
this approach has allowed us to find spatial organization of transcription
factor binding events, as well as their relationships with other epigenomic factors.
<br><br> The current computational
activities in our laboratory include the following areas: a) Application of
signal processing approaches for identification of relevant biological signals
in high-throughput experiments, such as identification of aberrations in
multi-subclonal cancer samples, signal denoising in next generation
platforms, and de-mixing of cell types in heterogeneous samples, b)
developing approaches to analyze high dimensional data from genomics platforms
for biomarker discovery and personalized medicine. In particular, we use
advanced applied mathematical methods to search complex local and non-local
genomic patterns across the genome that may discriminate cancer patients with
good vs. poor outcomes in CNA studies employing next generation sequencing or
SNP platforms and c) uncovering direct and collective regulatory relationships
between regulators (TFs, epigenomic factors and miRNAs) and their target genes
by integration of heterogeneous Omics datasets and DNA sequences.
<br><br> From a biological
standpoint we are particularly interested in:

a)  
Identification of primary or drug-treated metastatic
subclones with proliferation and invasion potential in heterogeneous cancer
biopsies

b)  
The interplay between regulatory motifs, chromatin
status and multi scale chromosomal structure

c)   
Determining whether complex traits associated with
certain common diseases vary across populations with different genetic
backgrounds

Recently he has examined aberrant tissue factor expression in endometriotic endothelium as a target for therapy using the immunoconjugate molecule, ICON.  He has over 220 peer reviewed publications, 39 chapters in distinguished text books, is editor of four text books, UpToDate - Obstetrics and Contemporary Ob/Gyn, the nation<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> must widely read Ob/Gyn journal.

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[The driving force behind my research and related scholarly activities has been my dedication to promoting the use of evidence-based psychosocial treatments in clinical settings. In the early 1990s, I began to apply motivational interviewing (MI) in the treatment of patients with severe mental illness and addictions. I engaged in a series of studies to develop this adaptation and empirically examined its treatment effects in a randomized clinical trial. At the time, few investigators had published about how to specifically apply MI to this dual diagnosis population and to test how well it worked. To my surprise, I found that MI was differentially effective with psychotically ill patients who abused cocaine, but not with those who abused marijuana. My work highlighted the complexities of enhancing motivation in patients with severe co-occurring mental illness and addiction.  From these efforts to tailor MI, I became more interested in studying how to effectively train clinicians in evidence-based practices.  I was impressed by the disciplined methods used to teach clinicians behavioral treatments in clinical trials (use of manuals, recording sessions, integrity rating, supervisory feedback and coaching, ongoing close monitoring of performance) and, ironically, how uncommon this careful training approach was employed in real world educational and practice settings.  This simple observation led me to shift my research toward dissemination and implementation science, and I became increasingly involved in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network.  Specifically, I assisted in the conduct of several national multi-site effectiveness trials involving MI. I had primary responsibility for serving as the local, and then national trainer, and developing an integrity rating scale and system to be used for supervision and independent observer treatment validation in the trials.  I took the lead in psychometrically validating the scale and developing a NIDA-SAMHSA national dissemination product called Motivational Interviewing Assessment: Supervisory Tools for Enhancing Proficiency â€“ a manual that details methods for supervising MI in community treatment programs.  Subsequently, I became the national trainer-of-trainers for MIA: STEP and played a key role in its dissemination nationally and internationally.  As a Principal Investigator, I am currently conducting a multi-site trial testing the effectiveness of MIA: STEP supervision on improving client outcomes and the extent to which clinician MI adherence and competence mediates this process.  To my knowledge, this will be the first clinical trial directly testing the impact of any form of psychotherapy supervision on client outcomes.   In addition, I have studied other strategies for training clinicians in evidence-based practices.  I have published studies that have examined the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a train-the-trainer approach for teaching community program clinicians behavioral treatments.  I also have piloted an innovative stepwise approach in which clinicians only receive more intensive treatment training if they fail to meet a criterion performance threshold.  The study showed the promise of more adaptive training program designs and suggested that future training trials screen participants to exclude those who already have the targeted skills and little room for improvement.

I have published studies that have examined the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a train-the-trainer approach for teaching community program clinicians behavioral treatments.  I also have piloted an innovative stepwise approach in which clinicians only receive more intensive treatment training if they fail to meet a criterion performance threshold.  The study showed the promise of more adaptive training program designs and suggested that future training trials screen participants to exclude those who already have the targeted skills and little room for improvement.  In a recent publication, I reviewed the clinician training strategies literature and identify key areas that need more research.

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[My primary research interest is in pulmonary hypertension in Sickle Cell Disease. Pulmonary hypertension occurs in one third of adults with sickle cell disease and is an independent risk factor for mortality. There was limited data on this complication in children. I designed a prospective screening study with Dr Alan Friedman (Cardiology) and Dr Alia Bazzy-Asaad (Pulmonary) to determine the prevalence and risk factors of elevated pulmonary artery pressures in children with homozygous SS or S 0 thalassemia using echocardiography. This study identified that elevated pulmonary artery pressures do occur in approximately 30% of children with sickle cell disease, and are associated with hypoxia, hemolysis and a high platelet count. This was the first prospective screening study in children, and showed that similar to adults, children with sickle cell disease do develop elevated pulmonary artery pressures. This work was presented at the Pediatric Academic Society Meeting in May 2007 and published in Pediatrics (Pashankar FD, Carbonella J, Bazzy-Asaad A, Friedman A. Prevalence of elevated pulmonary artery pressures in children with sickle cell disease. Pediatrics 2008 Apr; 121(4):777-82). This study has been widely quoted and has had an impact on decision to screen children with sickle cell disease for pulmonary hypertension.   Our screening study showed that similar to adults, children with sickle cell disease developed elevated pulmonary artery pressures. In adults, this complication is associated with significant mortality. However there was no data on the long term outcome and possible reversibility of this complication in children. Hemolysis has been shown to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. I designed a single institution pilot study to determine if treatment with Hydroxyurea, an antihemolytic agent could reverse elevated pulmonary artery pressures in children with sickle cell disease. This study showed that elevated pulmonary artery pressures were reversible with hydroxyurea in children with early detection and intervention. This study is important, because if elevated pulmonary artery pressures can be reversed in childhood with early detection and intervention, it will have a significant impact on reducing morbidity and mortality of this complication in adulthood. This work was published in the British Journal of Hematology (Pashankar FD, Carbonella J, Bazzy-Asaad A, Friedman A. Longitudinal follow up of elevated pulmonary pressures in children with Sickle Cell Disease. Br J Haematol. 2009 Mar;144(5):736-41 ).   Due to the exciting results from our single center pilot study, we are currently conducting a multicenter study to determine the effect of hydroxyurea on elevated pulmonary artery pressures in children with sickle cell disease.

Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Through co-evolution with their hosts, viruses have acquired exquisite mechanisms for coping with the anti-viral immune responses. Our lab is interested in detailing these viral coping mechanisms and examining their importance to pathogenicity, with the eventual goal of developing better prophylactic and treatment strategies. The major pathogens that we study are the gamma-herpesviruses, which include the most recently described human viral pathogen, Kaposi&rsquo;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This virus is the causal agent of one of the most common AIDS-associated cancers in the Western world, as well as being a leading cause of cancer deaths in many regions of Africa. We are in the process of characterizing several gene products of KSHV that are able to modulate and block the host immune response. Among these proteins are K3 and K5, able to down regulate multiple key immunomodulatory proteins from the surface of expressing cells, including MHC class I, B7.2, ICAM-1 and CD31. Studies of the molecular mechanisms of action of these proteins have not only provided potential targets for anti-viral therapies, but have also provided insights into the mechanisms of cellular endocytosis, trafficking and host control of the immune response. Another facet of our research is the characterization of the host immune responses being made against the virus. To aid us in these studies, we are taking advantage of several animal models utilizing closely related ?-herpesviruses including murid ?-herpesvirus (MHV-68) of rodents, Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) of New World non-human primates and rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV) of Old World non-human primates. In vitro gene expression and characterization experiments combined with in vivo infection experiments are allowing us to better describe the relationship between the virus and the host.

diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus

appear in the serum many years before the onset of clinical disease

established in healthy donors that random V(D)J recombination produce
large numbers of autoreactive antibodies.  Most developing B cells that
express polyreactive antibodies or B cell receptors (BCRs) are silenced
in the bone marrow, and additional autoreactive B cells are removed in
the periphery.  We recently analyzed B cell tolerance in RA patients by
testing the specificity of recombinant antibodies cloned from single B
cells.  RA patients exhibit defective central and peripheral B cell
tolerance checkpoints that result in the accumulation of self-reactive
mature naÃ¯ve B cells, likely contributing to the pathogenesis of this
disease.  Yet the mechanisms that lead to the generation and survival

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[By protein standards, our understanding of RNA structure and function is primitive because it was technically difficult to determine RNA structures for many years. Consequently, even though the technical problems have been overcome, there are lots of RNAsâ€”many of them recently discoveredâ€”for which we do not have structures, and hence cannot fully explain their functional properties.

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>My research continues to be concerned with the clinical pharmacology of drugs of abuse. Earlier research focused on the clinical pharmacology of cocaine, and in particular cocaethylene (EC) an interesting metabolite, which arises through transesterification of cocaine when cocaine and ethanol are used concurrently. Our studies indicated that EC, like cocaine, blocks the reuptake of monoamines including dopamine, is reinforcing in animals, and cannot be discriminated from cocaine by humans. EC has a longer half life than cocaine, is somewhat less potent, and has greater selectivity for the dopamine transporter. We thus suggested that EC might serve as a prototype drug for agonist substitution therapy for cocaine abuse. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>My laboratory has received support from an NIH funded Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center. We have been involved with several tobacco abuse treatment trials, and nicotine challenge studies on the assumption that the outcome of such studies cannot be optimally interpreted in the absence of objective data regarding nicotine exposure (as reflected by concentrations of nicotine and/or its major metabolite, cotinine, in plasma). Nicotine, with its short half life is a good marker of acute or very recent nicotine exposure, while its major proximal metabolite, cotinine, with its slower disposition is the superior marker of chronic nicotine exposure. One of our previous interesting findings was that schizophrenics demonstrate about twice the plasma cotinine levels per cigarette smoked when compared to non-schizophrenic smokers. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that schizophrenics, many of whom are heavy smokers, are self-medicating their disorder with tobacco smoking. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>We recently reported the results of a laboratory based study designed to quantify the relative reliability of various biochemical markers of smoking abstinence. Although, expired carbon monoxide (CO) is frequently used to confirm self reports, it has a relatively short half life, calling into question whether this measure might provide misleading information by exaggerating smoking cessation success rates. To examine this question, we analyzed expired CO, plasma cotinine and self report data collected in a clinical smoking abstinence clinical trial (N = 207). Measurements, which were made at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, showed that expired CO very significantly overestimated abstinence rates as compared with plasma cotinine. In fact self reports were more sensitive than expired CO.

Such assays are important for clinical trials that evaluate new therapies for substance abuse disorders, as well as for patient management in treatment programs. Alcohol (ethanol) is an exception. Blood alcohol concentrations become undetectable within hours after ethanol consumption, even following heavy drinking. EtG and EtS are minor ethanol metabolites, that, using very sensitive assays employing tandem mass spectrometry, can be measured in urine for several days following alcohol consumption.

Electrical resonance results when the inherent oscillation in the membrane potential of hair cells corresponds to sound of a particular frequency.  This gives rise to a resonance and amplification of signal with consequent transmitter release from these cells.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>The inherent oscillation in membrane potential in a hair cell is brought about by an inward Calcium current and an outward Potassium current (calcium dependent).  The systematic variation in the frequency of such an oscillation in hair cells that occurs across the tonotopic axis is brought about primarily by a variation in the kinetic properties of the Potassium current.  Previously we had shown that some of this variation in kinetic properties of this current was brought about by alternative splicing of this BK potassium channel.  However, a large part of this variation in kinetics cannot be explained by alternative splicing alone.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Our present hypothesis is that this variation in current is brought about by association with other proteins.  Towards this end we have made yeast two hybrid libraries from the cochlea organ and are screening these libraries for binding proteins using the purported intracellular domains of the BK channel as â€œbaitâ€. In addition we have also demonstrated by fluorescence immunohistochemistry that the calcium channel and the potassium channel are in fact in close physical approximation in these hair cells.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>There is considerable theoretical reasons to support this observation.  We have preliminary data that these two proteins are physically linked to one another.  We are presently attempting to duplicate these results using a more sensitive method of detection (tandem mass spec at the Keck facility). We are also seeking to identify proteins that might serve as scaffolding linking both these channels.   The role of Prestin (in Collaboration with Dr Joseph Santos Saatchi, Prof in Otolaryngology see www.yaleearlab.org) Prestin is a recently described protein in outer hair cells that is responsible for the sharp tuning seen in the hearing organ of mammals.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>It is critical for normal hearing.  Knocking out of this protein results in the loss of hearing in mice. Prestin is a â€œmotorâ€ protein that gives rise to electromotility in outer hair cells.  Its an unusual phenomenon in that motility in outer hair cells can be rapid, upto 20KHz, which is orders of magnitude faster than conventional motor proteins like myosin. We are attempting to determine the functional domains within this protein by mutagenesis.  We have made over a dozen mutants of this protein and are presently evaluating how it affects the motor function of this protein.   <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Regeneration in the auditory epithelium <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span>Hearing loss in the elderly population affects upto 60% of this age group.  This hearing loss is largely brought about by a loss in hair cells in the auditory epithelium.  In previous experiments we had demonstrated that increasing levels of the second messenger cyclic AMP results in a cascade of events giving rise to cell division and regeneration in hair cells.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>These results have since been duplicated in mice.  We are attempting to identify the molecular events that underlie such regeneration and we have undertaken a subtractive hybridization experiment to determine the identity of mRNA transcripts that are upregulated with increasing cAMP.

Leckman, M.D. is the Neison Harris Professor of Child Psychiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology and Pediatrics at Yale. He serves as the Director of Research for the Yale Child Study Center. Dr. Leckman is a well known child psychiatrist and patient-oriented clinical investigator. His peers have regularly selected him as one of the Best Doctors in America. Dr. Leckman is the author or co-author of over 300 original articles published in peer-reviewed journals, seven books, and 120 book chapters. In 2002, he was identified by American Society for Information, Science and Technology as a â€œHighly Cited Researcherâ€ - one of the world's most cited authors in Psychology and Psychiatry â€“ in the top half of the top one percent of all publishing researchers.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>In 1999, he edited with Dr. Donald J.

Given its success, this volume was re-issued in paper back in the fall of 2001. More recently, Dr. Leckman edited (along with Andres Martin, Lawrence Scahill and Dennis Charney) a 56-chapter volume, entitled, Pediatric Psychopharmacology: Principles and Practice published in October of 2002 by Oxford University Press. In November 2002, an invited review article on Touretteâ€™s syndrome appeared in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Clinical expertise<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Dr. Leckman is widely recognized as a committed clinician with special skills in the evaluation and treatment of Touretteâ€™s syndrome (TS) and early onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Since the early 1980s, he has seen and evaluated hundreds of individuals with these conditions. Physicians, patients and families from across the country and around the world regularly seek his advice. He is frequently invited to address professional, parent and advocacy groups at local, regional, and national meetings as well as international meetings. For example during the past four years, he has presented to professional and/or family groups in London, Rotterdam, Berlin, Rome, Johannesburg, Istanbul, Beirut, Sharm El Sheikh, Tehran, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Tokyo, Mexico City, Lima, and Sao Paulo. He is also a fully trained psychoanalyst.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Interdisciplinary research program on TS &amp; OCD<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>One of Dr. Leckmanâ€™s main research interests has been the interaction of genes and environment in the pathogenesis of TS and OCD.

Headlining this yearâ€™s contributions are original articles appearing in Science and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. One of these reports identify for the first time variations in a gene SLITRK1 that confer vulnerability to develop Touretteâ€™s syndrome. The other report is a study of donated postmortem brain tissue that documented dramatic changes in the cellular organization of individuals with severe, persistent, refractory Touretteâ€™s syndrome. We are particularly pleased that several of the first authors of these reports are either currently Yale undergraduates (Diana Feygin), medical students (Jesse Abelson and Paul Kalanithi), or recent medical school graduates (Michael Bloch).

Under normal circumstances, this is a time of transformation - a time when families come into being and what new parents value changes forever, as well as a time when a new person begins their journey through life. Projects include a prospective longitudinal study of typically developing families. In additional behavioral assessments, brain imaging studies have been an important feature. Another core mission of the program is to facilitate synergism across existing programs of research within the Center and the University as well as with leading investigative teams nationally. These affiliated projects between together investigators at the Child Study Center, as well as those in Psychology, Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Epidemiology and Public Health, Laboratory Medicine, Diagnostic Radiology, and the School of Nursing. Some of the highlights of the last year included a second annual conference that was held in the spring of 2006, entitled: â€œRisk, Resilience and Recovery: The Formation of the Family and the Effects of Trauma and Recurrent Stress: From Animal Models to Model Programs and Social Policy.â€<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Drs.

From the first meeting in Jerusalem in 2004, this group continues to meet both in the region and in Europe. The last meeting was in Rome in July 2006 where we heard the ongoing results from the first funded joint project that is jointly led by Ruth Feldman (Israel) and Iyad Hallaq (West Bank). Theirs is a remarkable project that extends from the Israeli settlements in Gaza to the Palestinian neighborhoods of Nablus. It focuses on the effects of witnessing combat and catastrophe by infants and their families. At the meeting we also developed guidelines for the next round of grant requests. They include: (1) the likelihood of a positive impact for Palestinian and Israeli children; (2) that it will be a joint project involving Israeli and Palestinian professionals; and (3) that it will be feasible and will be capacity building.

This effort led to the inauguration of the Albert J. Solnit Integrated Child and Adult Psychiatry Research Pathway at Yale in 2004. With the support of Yale University School of Medicine, NIH, and a group of private donors the Solnit Integrated Research Training Program was initiated to increase the number of physician-scientists with clinical and research skills.

Through early engagement with patients and their families, this program is designed to encourage medical students to become familiar with the special challenges associated with the care of children and adolescents with mental, behavioral and developmental disorders. Thus far, more that 80 Yale medical students have entered this program. Many are now envisioning careers in child psychiatry and a number are doing their thesis project with faculty at the Child Study Center.

										<li><p>James F. Leckman, M.D. is the Neison Harris Professor of Child Psychiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology and Pediatrics at Yale. He serves as the Director of Research for the Yale Child Study Center. Dr. Leckman is a well known child psychiatrist and patient-oriented clinical investigator. His peers have regularly selected him as one of the Best Doctors in America. Dr. Leckman is the author or co-author of over 300 original articles published in peer-reviewed journals, seven books, and 120 book chapters. In 2002, he was identified by American Society for Information, Science and Technology as a â€œHighly Cited Researcherâ€ - one of the world's most cited authors in Psychology and Psychiatry â€“ in the top half of the top one percent of all publishing researchers.</p><br><p>In 1999, he edited with Dr. Donald J. Cohen, Tourette's Syndrome: Tics, Obsessions, Compulsions - Developmental Psychopathology and Clinical Care, published by John Wiley&Sons. Given its success, this volume was re-issued in paper back in the fall of 2001. More recently, Dr. Leckman edited (along with Andres Martin, Lawrence Scahill and Dennis Charney) a 56-chapter volume, entitled, Pediatric Psychopharmacology: Principles and Practice published in October of 2002 by Oxford University Press. In November 2002, an invited review article on Touretteâ€™s syndrome appeared in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet.</p><p>Clinical expertise</p><br><p>Dr. Leckman is widely recognized as a committed clinician with special skills in the evaluation and treatment of Touretteâ€™s syndrome (TS) and early onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Since the early 1980s, he has seen and evaluated hundreds of individuals with these conditions. Physicians, patients and families from across the country and around the world regularly seek his advice. He is frequently invited to address professional, parent and advocacy groups at local, regional, and national meetings as well as international meetings. For example during the past four years, he has presented to professional and/or family groups in London, Rotterdam, Berlin, Rome, Johannesburg, Istanbul, Beirut, Sharm El Sheikh, Tehran, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Tokyo, Mexico City, Lima, and Sao Paulo. He is also a fully trained psychoanalyst.</p><p>Interdisciplinary research program on TS &amp; OCD</p><br><p>One of Dr. Leckmanâ€™s main research interests has been the interaction of genes and environment in the pathogenesis of TS and OCD. His research on these disorders is well known and multifaceted from phenomenology and natural history, to neurobiology (neuroimaging, neuroendocrinology, neuroimmunology) to genetics, to risk factor research (perinatal factors are important), to treatment studies.</p><br><p>2006 has been another productive year in the world of Touretteâ€™s syndrome and OCD here at Yale. Headlining this yearâ€™s contributions are original articles appearing in Science and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. One of these reports identify for the first time variations in a gene SLITRK1 that confer vulnerability to develop Touretteâ€™s syndrome. The other report is a study of donated postmortem brain tissue that documented dramatic changes in the cellular organization of individuals with severe, persistent, refractory Touretteâ€™s syndrome. We are particularly pleased that several of the first authors of these reports are either currently Yale undergraduates (Diana Feygin), medical students (Jesse Abelson and Paul Kalanithi), or recent medical school graduates (Michael Bloch). This bodes well for the future of research in this area as we bring along the next generation of scientific leaders.</p><br><p>Current projects focus on the role of post infectious autoimmune processes that may play a role in the development and course of some forms of TS and OCD. We are also working collaboratively to understand more about the electrophysiology of TS and OCD. This work includes EEG and magnetoencephalographic studies as well as the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat individuals with severe forms of these disorders.</p><p>Yale Program on Risk, Resilience and Recovery</p><br><p>With the support of Yale School of Medicine, the Institute for Research on Unlimited Love, and a group of private donors, Dr. Leckman partnering with Linda Mayes initiated a new research program that focuses on that special time in the lives of families â€“ from the pregnancy through the first years of life. Under normal circumstances, this is a time of transformation - a time when families come into being and what new parents value changes forever, as well as a time when a new person begins their journey through life. Projects include a prospective longitudinal study of typically developing families. In additional behavioral assessments, brain imaging studies have been an important feature. Another core mission of the program is to facilitate synergism across existing programs of research within the Center and the University as well as with leading investigative teams nationally. These affiliated projects between together investigators at the Child Study Center, as well as those in Psychology, Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Epidemiology and Public Health, Laboratory Medicine, Diagnostic Radiology, and the School of Nursing. Some of the highlights of the last year included a second annual conference that was held in the spring of 2006, entitled: â€œRisk, Resilience and Recovery: The Formation of the Family and the Effects of Trauma and Recurrent Stress: From Animal Models to Model Programs and Social Policy.â€</p><br><p>Drs. Leckman and Mayes also regularly teach an undergraduate seminar on Love and Attachment at Yale College that integrates the principles of evolutionary biology, ethology, and developmental neuroscience with the study of psychopathology.</p><p>ERICE (Empowerment and Resilience in Children Everywhere)</p><br><p>With the support of the Fondazione per lo Studio e la Ricera sull'Infanzia el'Adolescenza, Italian Government, the International Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, Dr. Leckman convened child mental health professionals from Israel, the West Bank and Gaza to discuss how best to improve the lives of children in this region of conflict. From the first meeting in Jerusalem in 2004, this group continues to meet both in the region and in Europe. The last meeting was in Rome in July 2006 where we heard the ongoing results from the first funded joint project that is jointly led by Ruth Feldman (Israel) and Iyad Hallaq (West Bank). Theirs is a remarkable project that extends from the Israeli settlements in Gaza to the Palestinian neighborhoods of Nablus. It focuses on the effects of witnessing combat and catastrophe by infants and their families. At the meeting we also developed guidelines for the next round of grant requests. They include: (1) the likelihood of a positive impact for Palestinian and Israeli children; (2) that it will be a joint project involving Israeli and Palestinian professionals; and (3) that it will be feasible and will be capacity building. Thus far, we have secured external funding from NARSAD and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation.</p><p>As part of his leadership of the research program at the Child Study Center, Dr. Leckman has directed for the past 23 years an institutional postdoctoral research training program at Yale. With seven postdoctoral positions awarded annually, this is one of the largest grants of this kind awarded by the NIMH. Several of the graduates of this program now occupy leadership positions in child psychiatric research nationally. Dr. Leckman has been selected on five occasions as the Outstanding Research Mentor by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists.</p><br><p>For two years Dr. Leckman served as the Co-Chair of the National Psychiatry Training Council. The NPTC was appointed by Thomas Insel, MD, Director, the National Institute of Mental Health to implement the recommendations of an Institute of Medicine committee report entitled: Research Training in Psychiatry Residency: Strategies for Reform. This effort led to the inauguration of the Albert J. Solnit Integrated Child and Adult Psychiatry Research Pathway at Yale in 2004. With the support of Yale University School of Medicine, NIH, and a group of private donors the Solnit Integrated Research Training Program was initiated to increase the number of physician-scientists with clinical and research skills. Dr. Leckman leads this effort nationally and one other site is active at the University of Colorado where there are also six trainees enrolled. </p><br><p>In 2002, to honor the memory of Donald J. Cohen, The Kingenstein Third Generation Foundation and the John &amp; Patricia Klingenstein Fund established the Donald J. Cohen Medical Student Fellowship program. Through early engagement with patients and their families, this program is designed to encourage medical students to become familiar with the special challenges associated with the care of children and adolescents with mental, behavioral and developmental disorders. Thus far, more that 80 Yale medical students have entered this program. Many are now envisioning careers in child psychiatry and a number are doing their thesis project with faculty at the Child Study Center. Based on the success of the Yale program the Board of the Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation has now funded five additional sites: Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Mt. Sinai, Stanford and the University of California at Davis. Here at Yale the other faculty involved in this effort include: Andres Martin, MD, MPH, and Samuel Ritvo, MD, along with a score of faculty mentors.</p>

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Our group focuses on the development (hardware and software) and application of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) techniques for the evaluation of neurological disorders. MRSI allows the chemical composition of the brain, including major neurotransmitters and metabolites, to be mapped at spatial resolutions of 0.5 milliliter (approximately a cube of 1/3 of an inch) or better. These measurements allow us to evaluate the biochemical status of the brain, including: 1) how well neurons are functioning; 2) the extent to which energy production in the brain meets demand; and  3) levels of the primary inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters. Although we have worked in a variety of areas (Alzheimerâ€™s, Multiple Sclerosis, Migraine, Addiction) our work currently focuses in two main areas: Epilepsy and Brain Tumors, with minor projects in Schizophrenia and Parkinsonâ€™s.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span> All of our human work is performed at 7T, of which approximately 25 system exist world wide. Spectroscopic studies are typically limited by SNR; however with increasing field strength, the SNR grows at least linearly. Unfortunately, power deposition grows by the second to the third power of the field strength, making conventional lower field (3T) spectroscopy methods unfeasible at 7T due to excessive tissue heating. Further due to tissue RF field interactions the homogeneity of conventional RF detectors degrades substantially resulting in a factor of two in inhomogeneity across objects the size of the human head. Finally the static magnetic field inhomogeneity grows linearly with field strength, degrading spectral resolution. To overcome these limitations the more technical components of our work focus on four areas: 1) the development of new multi channel (â€œtransceiverâ€) RF arrays which improve homogeneity and decrease power deposition; 2) the development of specialized hardware and software for ultra high magnetic field homogeneity within the brain; 3) and pulse sequences which utilize RF shimming concepts to provide anatomical localization with out the use of gradients thereby minimizing power deposition and eliminating chemical shift dispersion errors and 4) pulse sequences to acquire measurements of a variety of metabolites including NAA, glutamate and GABA.  <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span> Although there has been significant advances in the development of new drugs to treat epilepsy, about 1/3 of all people who have epilepsy continue to experience seizures. These seizures have a significant impact resulting in shortened life spans, a much higher incidence of psychiatric disorders, and, on a personal level, increased incidences of divorce, loss of jobs and revocation of driving privileges. In these subjects, surgery can provide an alternative when the location within the brain giving rise to the seizures can be identified. In neocortical epilepsy, surgical treatment is typically only successful in Â½ of the patients due to the limitations of conventional imaging methods in finding the origin of the seizures. In many other patients a failure to localize the seizures or their proximity to areas of key brain function preclude surgery as a treatment option. In epilepsy our work includes two main areas: 1) the application of MRSI to identify where seizures originate from for the purposes of surgical planning and 2) to better understand the biochemical changes associated with epilepsy so as to develop alternative methods for the medical treatment of seizures for patients in which surgery is not an option.   <span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Brain cancer remains amongst the most difficult to treat of all forms of human cancer. Although there has been significant progress in the development of new agents and the use of focused radiation to treat brain tumors, results vary dramatically amongst individuals. For this reason, monitoring of the effects of treatment are critical in determining the course of therapy, balancing treatment of the tumor versus damage caused to the brain due to the toxicity of the agents and approaches used. Unfortunately, conventional imaging methods (MRI and PET) can not discriminate the effects of radiation and chemotherapy from tumor regrowth during the first few months of therapy, delaying optimal therapy. Failure to treat tumor regrowth quickly results in poorer outcomes and tumor control, while additional courses of radiation and chemotherapy result in significant brain damage and loss of function. Our work is focused on using MRSI methods to resolve between tumor regrowth and brain injury due to therapy, using characteristic changes in tissue energy production seen in radiation injury. By resolving tumor regrowth from radiation and chemotherapy injury we will be able to more optimally manage treatment, using additional radiation treatments or other chemotherapeutic agents for tumor regrowth, or giving steroids to treat brain injury due to therapy.]</span>.

microRNA miR-430 that accelerates the deadenylation of maternal
products during embryogenesis to facilitate gastrulation.
Interestingly, misexpression of the human homologues (miR-372,
miR-17-93) have oncogenic potential. Thus, identification of the in
vivo miR-430 targets might provide a fundamental link between
development and cancer. 2) MicroRNAs are expressed at the onset of
differentiation and continue to be expressed through adulthood. We have
observed that miRNAs accelerate target mRNA degradation. Thus,
microRNAs targets can be identified by looking at mRNAs upregulated in
the absence of the microRNA. We are using microarray analysis in dicer
mutant embryos to identify tissue specific microRNA targets in neurons
and muscle cells. Computational projects in the lab will analyze the
regulatory motifs in microRNAs and 3’UTR elements of their targets to
identify the gene networks controlled by microRNAs. Combining in vivo
target identification with phenotypic characterization of dicer mutants
will help us to understand the function of tissue specific microRNAs
during cell fate specification and tissue homeostasis.</ins>

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Dr. Girardiâ€™s principal research focus as a faculty member has been
to investigate the relationship between the immune system and cancer
from two complimentary perspectives: as a laboratory / translational
investigator, and as a clinical scholar. He has published in high
impact journals (Science, Nature, New England Journal, Nature
Immunology, Journal of Experimental Medicine, Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences). In addition, he has developed an
internationally recognized clinical expertise in several areas
including cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), nephrogenic systemic
fibrosis (NSF), and the immunodulatory treatment extracorporeal
photochemotherapy (ECP). His scientific and clinical scholarly
accomplishments have been recently recognized by his elected membership
into the American Society for Clinical Investigation.
His laboratory has made several advances in our understanding of the
immunoregulation of carcinogenesis. They are credited as the first lab
to demonstrate the critical contribution of gamma/delta T cells to the
regulation of cutaneous malignancy using three different skin cancer
models [Science 2001]. This has directly led to the elucidation of the
differential contributions of alpha/beta T cells relative to
gamma/delta T cells [J Exp Med 2003]. Indicative of the influence of
different alpha/beta T components on tumor growth, tumor cells
populations reflect the immune status in that tumors developing in
immunocompetent mice differed substantially from those developing in
TCRbetaâ€“/â€“ or IFNgammaâ€“/â€“ mice by: (1) reduced expression of the
natural killer receptor (NKG2D) ligand Rae-1, (2) overt regional
necrosis reflected by an impoverished vasculature, and (3) reduced
expression of a set of genes implicated in angiogenesis [J Invest
Dermatol 2005]. We also identified and characterized a novel population
of CD8+ tumor-promoting T cells (T-pro) [PNAS 2007] that drives cancer
progression via local inflammatory influences. The identification of
these T-pro cells adds substantially to the recognized association of
inflammation and cancer, and has served as the basis for a
translational study of human tumors [NCI SPORE].
Another laboratory focus is on the resident gamma/delta+ (Vgamma5+)
dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC), and Dr. Girardiâ€™s laboratory
determined that DETC can kill SCC cells directly via the NKG2D ligand
Rae-1. Induced epithelial expression of NKG2D ligand was shown to
precipitate the reorganization of local immune components, including
DETC, natural killer T (NKT) cells, and Langerhans cells [Nature
Immunol 2008]. This may represent the earliest events in tumor
immunosurveillance. This work supports the paradigm of the response of
local immune components to the major stress molecules collectively
known as NKG2D-ligands, describing the dynamic intraepithelial
reorganization of T cells, dendritic cells, and NKT cells in skin and
within early tumors. The findings of the protective effects of local T
cells may be germane to the development of carcinoma across all
epithelial tissues (e.g. colon and lung cancer), provide ananimal model
for the surveillance of MICA+ tumors by local T cells, and have major
implications for the identification of novel immune targets of cancer
prevention and therapy for a spectrum of malignancies.]</span>. Actual:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Dr. Girardi’s principal research focus as a faculty member has been

Using psoralen-conjugated triplex-forming oligonucleotides, we initially demonstrated the feasibility of triplex-targeted mutagenesis in several model systems. We were able to determine conditions under which triplex oligonucleotides can enter cells and efficiently bind to and modify a target site within cells, leading to base pair specific mutations. Experiments with oligonucleotides not tethered to a reactive agent but capable of high affinity third strand binding revealed that triple helix formation can induce DNA repair and recombination in mammalian cells. This work has raised the possibility of using triplex formation as both a gene knock out and a gene correction modality.

We initially confirmed this hypothesis by measuring mutation frequencies in experimental tumors using a lambda-based chromosomal shuttle vector reporter system. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon we used a microarray-based approach to screen for hypoxia-regulated DNA repair pathways. We found that hypoxia specifically down-regulates the expression of Mlh1 and Rad51, key mediators of DNA mismatch repair and of homologous recombination in mammalian cells, respectively. Down-regulation of Mlh1 and Rad51 expression by hypoxia was observed in numerous cell lines from a wide range of tissues, and was not correlated with cell cycle profile or hypoxia-inducible factor expression. Rad51 down-regulation was also detected in vivo in the tumor microenvironment, as we observed consistent inverse correlations between hypoxia-marker staining and Rad51 expression by immunofluorescence in cervical and prostate cancer xenograft models. We propose the existence of a hypoxic phenotype in solid tumors, characterized by decreased expression of the critical DNA repair genes, Mlh1 and Rad51, representing a novel mechanism of acquired genetic instability in the tumor microenvironment and dysregulated DNA damage response in cancer cells.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Mechanism of cancer cell killing by cisplatin<span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Cisplatin is one of the most widely used cancer chemotherapy agents, but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Current models suggest that cell killing by cisplatin occurs in a cell-autonomous manner via formation of platinum-DNA adducts that, if not removed by DNA repair, block transcription and replication. We have found that there is a separate cell-interdependent pathway of cisplatin killing in which damaged cells can transmit a death signal to neighboring cells. This signal is produced within the damaged cell by the kinase function of the Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PK complex and is conveyed to the recipient cell by direct cell-to-cell communication through gap junctions. Our findings suggest that DNA-PK activity and gap junction expression in human cancers may influence the clinical response to cisplatin.

Ongoing collaborations include the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) at the University of Bristol (UK), the Colorado Learning Disabilities Research Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder, The Child Language Research Center at the University of Iowa, Case Western Reserve University, as well as numerous other national and international collaborators. Our goal for these studies is to identify genetic elements that substantially contribute to reading- and language-related processes in order to (1) gain valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying dyslexia and language impairment&mdash;and also into the mechanisms underlying the biology of normal reading and language&mdash;and (2) attempt to use genetic information to identify children that may be at risk for communication disorders, in order to apply early intervention and improve the outcome for these individuals.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>

Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS and exerts many of its diverse effects through oligomeric receptors that are ligand-gated channels. Multiple families of glutamate-receptor (GluR) subunits exist, and each family contains several subunit genes.

During the late 1990â€™s, most of our work focused on native channels. Using cerebellar granule cells as a convenient model system, we explored the expression and properties of GluRs in developing and mature neurons and investigated how the subunit composition of GluRs determines the functional properties of this important class of neuronal receptors. These studies revealed that developmental changes in kainate-type GluR subunit expression and processing are associated with changes in unitary channel properties (Smith et al., 1999). Other studies showed that granule cells begin to express multiple subtypes of AMPA-type GluR channels shortly before synaptogenesis and that some, but not all, of these subtypes are segregated to synapses in mature neurons (Ripellino et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2000). Both AMPA and kainate receptors in neurons in situ display multiple conductance levels. For AMPA receptors, the prevalence of sojourns in the different substates depends on the number of ligand molecules bound to the receptor (Smith and Howe, 2000). We also showed that alterations in the asynchrony of transmitter release and changes in receptor properties speed the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents at mossy fiber-granule cell synapses as these synapses mature (Wall et al., 2002).

Most of our recent work has focused on the kinetic behavior of recombinant glutamate receptors. A good deal about the structure of these receptors has emerged during the last several years, particularly for the ligand-binding domain, and we are trying to understand how major conformational changes impact receptor function. We provided the first functional evidence that AMPA receptors are dimers of dimers (Robert et al., 2001) and proposed new kinetic models that account for the structural data and differ significantly from previous kinetic schemes (Robert and Howe, 2003, Robert et al., 2005). We resolved a controversy regarding the effect of lurcher, a spontaneously arising mutation in a highly conserved motif in one of the transmembrane segments of AMPA receptors (Klein and Howe, 2004), and contributed to work showing that NMDA receptor kinetics influence the coincidence detection that underlies LTP (Popescu et al., 2004). We also demonstrated that an auxiliary protein, stargazin, has effects on the kinetics of single-channel currents that account for its slowing of the decay of excitatory postsynaptic currents (Tomita et al., 2005).

My laboratory is interested in the problem of embryonic

correctly leads to congenital malformations in children, a significant cause of
inherited childhood diseases.

We are particularly interested in
cellular signals and transcriptional regulation that lead to particular fate
changes that specify new tissue types during development.  We are also interested in morphogenesis
that provides shape to the developing embryo.  We have three approaches to discover these patterning
events:  1) genetic screens in Xenopus tropicalis 2) quantitative analysis
of Xenopus epidermis to create a
coordinated field of cells 3) human genetic studies of children with congenital
malformations.

 

We focus on Xenopus
as a model system because of the power of the frog system for gain of function
and experimental embryology (â€œcut-and-pasteâ€ developmental biology).  In addition, we have pioneered X. tropicalis as an amphibian genetic

A number of mutants have been identified in previous genetic
screens and additional screens are ongoing.  Mutants that have been identified are now being cloned using
next-gen sequencing and exon capture arrays.  Once cloned, we are using all the power of the Xenopus
system to analyze gene function.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/li]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[li]</span>Analysis
of human mutations using Xenopus

In collaboration with Lifton and Brueckner labs, we have
identified a number of genes that are mutated in patients that have congenital
heart disease, a failure to properly pattern the heart.  We have validated a number of these
genes by showing that they also cause abnormal development of frog hearts and
are now analyzing the mechanisms of their development.  Many of these genes are novel and
identifying their mechanisms of cardiac morphogenesis will lead to new
understanding of congenital malformations and the underlying developmental
biology.

analysis of a field of ciliated cells that create fluid flow

Specific cells on the epidermis of the Xenopus embryos are ciliated. 
These ciliated cells beat in a coordinated fashion to create flow across
the entire length of the embryo. 
How these cells generate flow and sense flow to coordinate their beating
remains uncertain.  We are using
advanced imaging techniques and quantitative biology to better understand how
cilia driven flow is established and maintained.  In addition, we have identified cilia mutants that have
abnormal flow and so combining mutants, morpholino knockdowns, ablations, and
transplants, we hope to better understand how local cells can coordinate
cellular pattern over a large field of cells.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/li]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[/ul]</span>]</span>. Comparing Research Overview(s)

that provides shape to the developing embryo.  We have three approaches to discover these patterning
events:  1) genetic screens in Xenopus tropicalis 2) quantitative analysis

malformations.

 

We focus on Xenopus
as a model system because of the power of the frog system for gain of function
and experimental embryology (â€œcut-and-pasteâ€ developmental biology).  In addition, we have pioneered X. tropicalis as an amphibian genetic
system because of its diploid genome and genomic tools.

My laboratory is interested in the problem of embryonic
patterning.  A fertilized egg must
activate a complex genetic program in order to form functional adult
structures.  Failure to do so
correctly leads to congenital malformations in children, a significant cause of
inherited childhood diseases.

We are particularly interested in
cellular signals and transcriptional regulation that lead to particular fate
changes that specify new tissue types during development.  We are also interested in morphogenesis
that provides shape to the developing embryo.  We have three approaches to discover these patterning
events:  1) genetic screens in Xenopus tropicalis 2) quantitative analysis
of Xenopus epidermis to create a
coordinated field of cells 3) human genetic studies of children with congenital
malformations.

 

We focus on Xenopus
as a model system because of the power of the frog system for gain of function
and experimental embryology (<del class='diffmod'>â€œcut</del><ins class='diffmod'>“cut</ins>-and-paste<del class='diffmod'>â€</del><ins class='diffmod'>”</ins> developmental biology).  In addition, we have pioneered X. tropicalis as an amphibian genetic

Analysis
of X. tropicalis mutants

A number of mutants have been identified in previous genetic
screens and additional screens are ongoing.  Mutants that have been identified are now being cloned using
next-gen sequencing and exon capture arrays.  Once cloned, we are using all the power of the Xenopus
system to analyze gene function.</ins></li><li><ins class='diffins'>Analysis
of human mutations using Xenopus

In collaboration with Lifton and Brueckner labs, we have
identified a number of genes that are mutated in patients that have congenital
heart disease, a failure to properly pattern the heart.  We have validated a number of these
genes by showing that they also cause abnormal development of frog hearts and
are now analyzing the mechanisms of their development.  Many of these genes are novel and
identifying their mechanisms of cardiac morphogenesis will lead to new
understanding of congenital malformations and the underlying developmental
biology.

  
</ins></li><li><ins class='diffins'>Quantitative
analysis of a field of ciliated cells that create fluid flow

Specific cells on the epidermis of the Xenopus embryos are ciliated. 
These ciliated cells beat in a coordinated fashion to create flow across
the entire length of the embryo. 
How these cells generate flow and sense flow to coordinate their beating
remains uncertain.  We are using
advanced imaging techniques and quantitative biology to better understand how
cilia driven flow is established and maintained.  In addition, we have identified cilia mutants that have
abnormal flow and so combining mutants, morpholino knockdowns, ablations, and
transplants, we hope to better understand how local cells can coordinate
cellular pattern over a large field of cells.</ins></li></ul>

Specifically, we have focused on the lung endothelium as a central mediator of lung injury and repair responses.  We identified the importance of the stress-response protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its gaseous reaction product, carbon monoxide (CO), in resisting oxidant-induced endothelial cell death via mitochondrial pathways.  We found that a family of signaling molecules, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), mediates HO-1 and CO&rsquo;s protective effects as well as optimal IL-13-induced lung inflammation / remodeling and, more recently, critical innate immune responses.  The innate immune system consists of pattern-recognition receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs), of which TLR4 is the LPS-responsive receptor.  We discovered that TLR4 is required for lung structural cell survival in aging and oxidant-challenged conditions.

My research concerns psychosocial predictors of risk and mechanisms underlying addictive behaviors, principally high-risk alcohol use in young adults, cocaine use and smoking. The psychosocial risk factors and mechanisms of greatest interest to me concern disinhibition, both at trait and state levels. The decision to abuse substances is inherently impulsive in that it represents a choice of immediate reinforcers (e.g., euphoria from substance use) over larger, delayed reinforcers (e.g., avoiding adverse consequences). Therefore, the strength of association between addictive behaviors and aspects of disinhibition is not surprising. In recent years, I have become very interested in cognitive biases underlying addictive behaviors. For instance frequent substance users tend to devote inordinate attention to substance-related stimuli in their environment. Two of my primary research projects concern novel procedures to ameliorate these cognitive biases.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>State and Trait Disinhibition <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>&ldquo;Disinhibition&rdquo; has been defined as the loss of restraint over some form of behaviour&rdquo; (Bond, 1998, p. 42). Trait disinhibition can be manifested as any number of traits including types of impulsivity, sensation seeking and a propensity toward risk taking. These traits have been associated with alcohol use and increased risk of problem drinking in young adults (e.g., Anderson, Smith,& Fischer, 2003; Grekin & Sher, 2006). We also know that alcohol and other addictive substances can induce states of disinhibition, the behavioral output of which resembles that of trait disinhibition (Bond 1998; Lyvers, 2000). We know less, however, about alcohol-induced disinhibition as a predictor of problem drinking. We also know little about whether there are discernable types of alcohol-induced disinhibition. These issues are addressed in a recent review article (Leeman, Grant, & Potenza, 2009). <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>Survey Research Concerning Disinhibition Expectancies and Impaired Control <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>To address these gaps in the literature, as part of my dissertation research, I developed the Drinking-Induced Disinhibition Scale (DIDS; Leeman, Toll, & Volpicelli, 2007). The DIDS is a reliable, valid measure of expectancies of three types of alcohol&rsquo;s disinhibiting effects (i.e., euphoric/social, dysphoric and sexual). In other words, this scale measures drinkers&rsquo; beliefs that they will experience certain effects to a greater extent when they drink than when not drinking. Since the initial work on the measure, we have completed a prospective study in which the DIDS, along with other variables assessed during freshman year, were included in models to predict problem drinking reported during senior year by a cohort of undergraduates (Leeman, Toll, Taylor, & Volpicelli, 2009). The euphoric/social subscale&mdash;which measures expectancies that one will be more fun and social when drinking than when not&mdash;assessed during freshman year predicted unique variance in heavy episodic drinking reported during senior year. The DIDS has been translated into Danish (Hesse & Tutenges, 2008). The convergent validity and the factor structure of the measure were confirmed in the Dutch study. At present, we are working on a new subscale to assess aggressive disinhibition. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>Impairment in self-control can also manifest itself as difficulties in limiting one&rsquo;s substance use. Impaired control over substance use (i.e., difficulties in limiting substance use, especially once initial use has begun) has long been viewed as a hallmark of addiction (Levine, 1978; O&rsquo;Brien et al., 2006). My colleagues and I established that impaired control predicted unique variance in heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related problems (i.e., negative consequences of alcohol use and aspects of alcohol dependence) in cross-sectional models using the freshman year wave of the aforementioned prospective study (Leeman, Fenton, & Volpicelli, 2007). Subsequently, we found that impaired control assessed during freshman year predicted unique variance in alcohol-related problems during senior year (Leeman, Toll, Taylor, & Volpicelli, 2009). <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>Human Laboratory Models of Addictive Behaviors <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>Another area of my research is in human laboratory models of aspects of addictive behaviors. Specifically, I am interested in laboratory models that further my research interests in links between disinhibition and addictive behaviors. My colleagues and I completed a study in which we used a human laboratory model of smoking lapse behavior (McKee, 2009) to examine the combined effect of nicotine and food deprivation, compared to nicotine deprivation alone, on ability to resist smoking and on subsequent ad-libitum (i.e., open access) smoking behavior (Leeman, O&rsquo;Malley, White, & McKee, 2010). We found that when daily smokers were deprived of food in addition to nicotine, they had more difficulty resisting smoking their first cigarette than smokers who were nicotine deprived only. Recent findings have suggested, like substance use, deprivation can also induce disinhibition. Mitchell (2004) found that nicotine-dependent individuals were more likely to favor immediate cigarettes over delayed money when nicotine deprived than when not deprived. The laboratory model used in our study could be viewed as a model of deprivation-induced disinhibition. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>My colleagues and I have developed a human laboratory paradigm to model impaired control over alcohol use in young adults (Leeman et al., 2013). Initial evidence suggests that his paradigm has utility for testing the preliminary efficacy of treatments to reduce heavy drinking in young adults (e.g., cognitive bias modification procedures: see below). Given the prevalence (Wechsler, Lee, Nelson, & Kuo, 2002) and deleterious results (Perkins, 2002) of heavy drinking among young adults, new, efficacious harm reduction approaches are needed for this population. A time and cost-effective method to evaluate these treatment approaches would be valuable to the field. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>Interventions to Reduce Heavy Drinking in Young Adults<span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>I collaborated on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the combined efficacy of the FDA-approved, opiate antagonist naltrexone and BASICS (Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students; Dimeff et al., 1999) to reduce heavy drinking in 18-25 year olds. We conducted an open-label pilot study of this approach, the findings of which suggested that this line of research is feasible and potentially efficacious (Leeman, Palmer, Corbin, Romano, Meandzija, & O'Malley, 2008). This five-year NIAAA-funded study began in September 2007. The study contains a comprehensive battery of psychosocial predictors collected both intermittently throughout the study and on a daily basis during the screening and treatment periods. Inclusion of these assessments will permit analyses to identify mechanisms underlying the effects of this treatment approach.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Currently, we are in the second year of a randomized, clinical trial to test a very brief (10 minutes or less), web-based alcohol reduction intervention for college students. This intervention, called THRIVE (Kypri et al., 2009) has been utilized successfully in Australia. We have adapted the intervention for use in the United States (US-THRIVE). In addition to attempting to replicate the Kypri et al. findings, we are conducting novel tests of focused sets of protective behavioral strategies included as part of this intervention. This intervention has great dissemination potential, given its accessibility, very brief duration and evidence for its efficacy.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>

We also know that alcohol and other addictive substances can induce states of disinhibition, the behavioral output of which resembles that of trait disinhibition (Bond 1998; Lyvers, 2000). We know less, however, about alcohol-induced disinhibition as a predictor of problem drinking. We also know little about whether there are discernable types of alcohol-induced disinhibition. These issues are addressed in a recent review article (Leeman, Grant, & Potenza, 2009). <br /><br />Survey Research Concerning Disinhibition Expectancies and Impaired Control <br /><br />To address these gaps in the literature, as part of my dissertation research, I developed the Drinking-Induced Disinhibition Scale (DIDS; Leeman, Toll, & Volpicelli, 2007). The DIDS is a reliable, valid measure of expectancies of three types of alcohol&rsquo;s disinhibiting effects (i.e., euphoric/social, dysphoric and sexual). In other words, this scale measures drinkers&rsquo; beliefs that they will experience certain effects to a greater extent when they drink than when not drinking. Since the initial work on the measure, we have completed a prospective study in which the DIDS, along with other variables assessed during freshman year, were included in models to predict problem drinking reported during senior year by a cohort of undergraduates (Leeman, Toll, Taylor, & Volpicelli, 2009). The euphoric/social subscale&mdash;which measures expectancies that one will be more fun and social when drinking than when not&mdash;assessed during freshman year predicted unique variance in heavy episodic drinking reported during senior year. The DIDS has been translated into Danish (Hesse & Tutenges, 2008). The convergent validity and the factor structure of the measure were confirmed in the Dutch study. At present, we are working on a new subscale to assess aggressive disinhibition. <br /><br />Impairment in self-control can also manifest itself as difficulties in limiting one&rsquo;s substance use. Impaired control over substance use (i.e., difficulties in limiting substance use, especially once initial use has begun) has long been viewed as a hallmark of addiction (Levine, 1978; O&rsquo;Brien et al., 2006). My colleagues and I established that impaired control predicted unique variance in heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related problems (i.e., negative consequences of alcohol use and aspects of alcohol dependence) in cross-sectional models using the freshman year wave of the aforementioned prospective study (Leeman, Fenton, & Volpicelli, 2007). Subsequently, we found that impaired control assessed during freshman year predicted unique variance in alcohol-related problems during senior year (Leeman, Toll, Taylor, & Volpicelli, 2009). <br /><br />Human Laboratory Models of Addictive Behaviors <br /><br />Another area of my research is in human laboratory models of aspects of addictive behaviors. Specifically, I am interested in laboratory models that further my research interests in links between disinhibition and addictive behaviors. My colleagues and I completed a study in which we used a human laboratory model of smoking lapse behavior (McKee, 2009) to examine the combined effect of nicotine and food deprivation, compared to nicotine deprivation alone, on ability to resist smoking and on subsequent ad-libitum (i.e., open access) smoking behavior (Leeman, O&rsquo;Malley, White, & McKee, 2010). We found that when daily smokers were deprived of food in addition to nicotine, they had more difficulty resisting smoking their first cigarette than smokers who were nicotine deprived only. Recent findings have suggested, like substance use, deprivation can also induce disinhibition. Mitchell (2004) found that nicotine-dependent individuals were more likely to favor immediate cigarettes over delayed money when nicotine deprived than when not deprived. The laboratory model used in our study could be viewed as a model of deprivation-induced disinhibition. <br /><br />My colleagues and I have developed a human laboratory paradigm to model impaired control over alcohol use in young adults (Leeman et al., 2013). Initial evidence suggests that his paradigm has utility for testing the preliminary efficacy of treatments to reduce heavy drinking in young adults (e.g., cognitive bias modification procedures: see below). Given the prevalence (Wechsler, Lee, Nelson, & Kuo, 2002) and deleterious results (Perkins, 2002) of heavy drinking among young adults, new, efficacious harm reduction approaches are needed for this population. A time and cost-effective method to evaluate these treatment approaches would be valuable to the field. <br /><br />Interventions to Reduce Heavy Drinking in Young Adults<br /><br />I collaborated on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the combined efficacy of the FDA-approved, opiate antagonist naltrexone and BASICS (Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students; Dimeff et al., 1999) to reduce heavy drinking in 18-25 year olds. We conducted an open-label pilot study of this approach, the findings of which suggested that this line of research is feasible and potentially efficacious (Leeman, Palmer, Corbin, Romano, Meandzija, & O'Malley, 2008). This five-year NIAAA-funded study began in September 2007. The study contains a comprehensive battery of psychosocial predictors collected both intermittently throughout the study and on a daily basis during the screening and treatment periods. Inclusion of these assessments will permit analyses to identify mechanisms underlying the effects of this treatment approach.</p>
<p>Currently, we are in the second year of a randomized, clinical trial to test a very brief (10 minutes or less), web-based alcohol reduction intervention for college students. This intervention, called THRIVE (Kypri et al., 2009) has been utilized successfully in Australia. We have adapted the intervention for use in the United States (US-THRIVE). In addition to attempting to replicate the Kypri et al. findings, we are conducting novel tests of focused sets of protective behavioral strategies included as part of this intervention. This intervention has great dissemination potential, given its accessibility, very brief duration and evidence for its efficacy.</p>
<p>Cognitive Biases Underlying Addictive Behaviors</p>
<p>More recently, I have become interested in ways to ameliorate cognitive biases underlying addictive behaviors (Wiers et al., 2013). For instance, many substance users have automatic tendencies to approach these substances and related stimuli. I currently have two research projects to test new approaches to reduce these tendencies (i.e., cognitive bias modification): one involving frequent heavy drinking young adults and another for opioid-maintained cocaine users at the West Haven VA. </p>

										<li>										<p>Overview of Research Interests <br /><br />Addictive behaviors are an important public health problem, associated with morbidity, mortality and high financial cost to society. My research concerns psychosocial predictors of risk and mechanisms underlying addictive behaviors, principally high-risk alcohol use in young adults, cocaine use and smoking. The psychosocial risk factors and mechanisms of greatest interest to me concern disinhibition, both at trait and state levels. The decision to abuse substances is inherently impulsive in that it represents a choice of immediate reinforcers (e.g., euphoria from substance use) over larger, delayed reinforcers (e.g., avoiding adverse consequences). Therefore, the strength of association between addictive behaviors and aspects of disinhibition is not surprising. In recent years, I have become very interested in cognitive biases underlying addictive behaviors. For instance frequent substance users tend to devote inordinate attention to substance-related stimuli in their environment. Two of my primary research projects concern novel procedures to ameliorate these cognitive biases.<br /><br />State and Trait Disinhibition <br /><br />&ldquo;Disinhibition&rdquo; has been defined as the loss of restraint over some form of behaviour&rdquo; (Bond, 1998, p. 42). Trait disinhibition can be manifested as any number of traits including types of impulsivity, sensation seeking and a propensity toward risk taking. These traits have been associated with alcohol use and increased risk of problem drinking in young adults (e.g., Anderson, Smith,& Fischer, 2003; Grekin & Sher, 2006).

Specifically, we are using primary cells as well as murine and human embryonic stem cells to study RBM15 and MKL1, two genes that are fused in the t(1;22) translocation associated with Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia AMKL). We are studying the roles of RBM15 and MKL1 in normal myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis.   We have shown that RBM15 is downregulated as hematopoietic stem cells differentiate down the myeloid lineage such that megakaryoblasts express low levels of RBM15.

RBM15 is a member of the spen family of proteins that share a C-terminal SPOC domain that bind to the nuclear corepressor complex. Consistent with other members of the SPOC domain family that can affect Notch signaling, we have shown that RBM15 represses Notch induced Hes1 promoter activity.

To this end, my research focuses on understanding a a host of factors that mediate the intensity, content and duration of abstinence such as sex/gender, age, concurrent substance use and depression. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>From a treatment development perspective, we are primarily focusing on two separate areas. In the first, we have developed and are using an alcohol self-administration paradigm in alcohol dependence drinkers to screen new medications that could reduce drinking behavior. In the area of tobacco dependence, we are developing innovative school-based prevention and cessation programs for adolescent smokers. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>In the area of alcohol drinking, we are interested in understanding alcohol drinking behavior and evaluating the efficacy of new medications in reducing drinking behavior. This research is conducted using a human laboratory alcohol drinking paradigm for adult heavy drinkers developed by our group at Yale. Laboratory paradigms provide researchers with the opportunity to manipulate factors that may have predictive utility in treatment outcome in a controlled environment. Using this paradigm to evaluate naltrexone, one of two FDA approved medications for alcoholism, we recently demonstrated that naltrexone reduced drinking only in drinkers with a positive family history of alcoholism. Thus, the efficacy of naltrexone, while modest in unselected samples, may be maximized by targeting the treatment to those with a genetic risk for alcoholism. Currently, we are using these laboratory paradigms to evaluate the influence of glutamatergic agents on alcohol drinking behaviors. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>Use of many substances, particularly tobacco, alcohol and marijuana is established during adolescence. Unfortunately, we know little about what maintains substance use behaviors in adolescents and there are few empirically validated treatments for this population. We have shown for the first time that while adolescent smokers show minimal symptoms on traditional withdrawal measures during abstinence from cigarettes, there are clinically significant gender-related changes in stress responses and cognition. These findings suggest that adolescents may be smoking to modulate stress reactivity and cognitive performance and emphasize the need for gender-specific treatments addressing tobacco-abstinence induced changes. We have used surveys to examine the relationships between a number of high risk behaviors including substance use, gambling, stealing among high school and middle school students, as well as to examine adolescents perceptions and attitudes towards school-based prevention and cessation programs. We have also used behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to evaluate the role of personality factors like impulsivity and risk taking behaviors in predicting both initiation and cessation of substance use in adolescents. <span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br /]</span>In the area of adolescent tobacco use, we are developing unique prevention and cessation programs that use behavioral reinforcement techniques. For example, we have developed a unique school based cessation program for adolescent smokers that uses Contingency Management (CM) based techniques to reinforce tobacco abstinence in combination with cognitive behavioral smoking cessation therapy. CM is an approach that reinforces target behaviors (such as abstinence) and has had a profound effect on the field of behavioral therapies for substance use in adults.

and successfully achieving pregnancy. Since a majority of cases of unexplained
infertility may result from implantation failure, there is a need to assess the
endometrium accurately for defects that could preclude implantation. Current
tools for endometrial evaluation, however, are limited. Based on endometrial
expression of cyclin E and p27, we have developed a patented endometrial
function test (EFTÂ®) which allows us to evaluate at a molecular level the
menstrual cycle regulatory cyclins and to differentiate between normally and
abnormally developing, endometrium. Ultimately, we hope this test will prove
useful to reproductive endocrinologists in evaluating menstrual cycle
irregularities as well as implantation potential. In addition, given that
cyclin E and p27 are regulated by estrogen and progesterone, this test may have
a role in evaluating the effects of these hormonesâ€™ exogenous administration in
infertility treatments as well as in other circumstances such as hormone
replacement therapy of peri- and post-menopausal women and in clinical
conditions that are known to alter or disrupt normal menstrual cycle function.
Currently the EFT is used to evaluate patients with infertility and recurrent
pregnancy loss. The full potential of these markers will need to be established
with prospective, case-controlled multi-center trials that examine different
groups of infertility patients to investigate the accuracy of the EFT in
predicting pregnancy outcomes in natural cycles, IVF, and donor oocyte
patients, work that is currently underway in our laboratory.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Structural Defects in the Placenta Suggest the Presence of

embryo, fetus and, eventually, baby) and the trophoblasts (which will become

will form the basis of the entire organism. Defects in the genes that regulate
these processes lead to a wide range of embryonic, fetal and neonatal defects,
from minor cosmetic abnormalities, to disasters that terminate pregnancy within
a few days to weeks after fertilization. Since the placenta and fetus share the

abnormal growth patterns. The cellular basis of these placental growth patterns
is the dynamic relationship between cytotrophoblast replication and
differentiation towards syncytiotrophoblast. We have identified an abnormal
growth pattern of the trophoblast layers which appears to be associated with
genetic defects in the fetus: trophoblast invaginations. When these deep pits
are cut in cross section they appear as trophoblast inclusions. We have shown
that compared to the placentas from normal children there is a significantly

the growth of the fetus without any insight into the growth the placenta. In situations where the
placenta is significantly small or large for gestational age a care giver may
not have any warning that the fetus is compromised or near death until it is
too late. This invention teaches the
use of mathematical equations to estimate
the in utero placental volume using three basic measurements:

their functional lifecycles. Briefly, after synthesis and transport into the
endoplasmic reticulum, secreted proteins are initially exposed to a near neutral
pH, which is later acidified to around 6.0 in the trans-Golgi and to 5.0 in the
dense cores of secretory granules. Once released into extracellular fluid, the
pH varies from 6.5 â€“ 7.8; but, after recognition and activation of cell surface
receptors, endocytosed ligand-receptor complexes experience a step-wise
lowering of acidity first to pH ~ 6.5 in mature endosomes, to pH ~ 5.5 in late
endosomes, and, if not directed back to the cell surface for recycling, to a
lysosomal pH &lt; 5. Given recent evidence for continued receptor signaling
from the endosomal compartment and for the complex intertwining of the signal
transduction and endocytic machineries, the overall activity of protein
hormones must depend on their response to these regulated changes in localized pH.
In a sense, protonation of ionizable groups in proteins is analogous to the
interaction of other cations, such as Zn<span style='color:red;']</span>[sup]</span>2+<span style='color:red;']</span>[/sup]</span> and Ca<span style='color:red;']</span>[sup]</span>2+<span style='color:red;']</span>[/sup]</span> that

to focus on the protein hormones, hPRL and hGH, and their respective cell
surface receptors (hPRLr and hGHr) due to our previous experience investigating
this protein family
and our discovery of a nearly one thousand-fold loss of binding affinity of
hPRL for its receptor over the narrow range of pH from 7.5 to 6.0; whereas, the affinity of hGH
binding to the same receptor remains essentially constant. We hypothesize
that this difference in pH dependence depends entirely on structural changes in
the intermolecular interfaces of these two hormone receptor complexes. We
will also test the hypothesis that acid-induced dissociation of endocytosed
hormone-receptor complexes (or lack thereof) regulates intracellular trafficking
towards either lysosomal degradation or recycling back to the cell surface. Our approach relies on a combination of measurement of site-specific protonation reactions using both NMR spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry, modeling of the thermodynamic linkage between receptor-binding and protonation, high resolution structural analysis of hormone-receptor complexes, and complementary cellular studies.

TUG, that regulates GLUT4 trafficking. Discovered by our collaborator, 
Dr. Jonathan Bogan, TUG binds directly to GLUT4-containing vesicles and 
tethers them intracellularly. In response to insulin, TUG releases GLUT4
 allowing translocation to the plasma membrane. Like many other 
proteins, TUG is composed of a modular array of independent protein 
domains. Our long term goal is to determine the tertiary 
structures of these TUG domains, to structurally characterize their 
interactions with each other and with a number of associated proteins, 
and ultimately to develop a detailed molecular model for TUG-regulated 
GLUT4 trafficking. A combination of sequence analysis and experimental 
studies has identified a number of ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains in TUG. We
 have chosen these UBL domains as the initial focus of our structural 
studies because of (1) their demonstrated functional importance in 
TUG-mediated GLUT4 tethering and release, (2) the clear delineation of 
their structural domain boundaries based on sequence alignment, and (3) a

This metabolic diversity complicates the administration of pharmaceutical agents to combat disease, resulting in variable levels of efficacy and toxicity from the same dosage of medications applied across a population. Ideally, the selection and dosing of individual medications would be specifically tailored to a predicted response within an individual. The scientific study of this genetic diversity and its relation to the administration of pharmaceuticals is the focus of the developing field of pharmacogenetics. <br><br>One common biological mechanism for generating diversity in metabolic pathways involves inherited polymorphisms in the protein sequence of enzymes, which appear to target the polymorphic proteins for intracellular degradation. We would like to understand the structural and biophysical mechanisms by which genetic polymorphisms within the protein sequences of these enzymes modulate their relative role in drug metabolism and, consequently, on the variable efficacy and toxicity of administered pharmaceuticals. Our work so far has concentrated on the enzyme, thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which metabolizes the class of 6-thiopurine medications, including 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine and azathioprine. Large variations of TPMT activity exist in humans and a variety of genetic polymorphisms in the TPMT protein sequence have been identified that target the allelic variants for proteasomal degradation. <br><br>We have determined the three-dimensional structure of TPMT using NMR spectroscopy and characterized the consequences of ligand-binding on the conformation and molecular dynamics of the polypeptide backbone. We are currently analyzing the consequences of the polymorphic mutations on the structural and functional properties of TPMT in order to characterize the molecular basis for increased susceptibility to intracellular degradation.<br><br><strong>The GLUT4-tethering protein, TUG. </strong>This project focuses on the 
interactions between the insulin-regulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, 
found in muscle and adipose cells and a recently discovered protein, 
TUG, that regulates GLUT4 trafficking. Discovered by our collaborator, 
Dr. Jonathan Bogan, TUG binds directly to GLUT4-containing vesicles and 
tethers them intracellularly. In response to insulin, TUG releases GLUT4
 allowing translocation to the plasma membrane. Like many other 
proteins, TUG is composed of a modular array of independent protein 
domains. Our long term goal is to determine the tertiary 
structures of these TUG domains, to structurally characterize their 
interactions with each other and with a number of associated proteins, 
and ultimately to develop a detailed molecular model for TUG-regulated 
GLUT4 trafficking. A combination of sequence analysis and experimental 
studies has identified a number of ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains in TUG. We
 have chosen these UBL domains as the initial focus of our structural 
studies because of (1) their demonstrated functional importance in 
TUG-mediated GLUT4 tethering and release, (2) the clear delineation of 
their structural domain boundaries based on sequence alignment, and (3) a
 pre-existing knowledge base of their potential interactions partners 
based on the conserved functions of homologous UBL domains in other 
proteins. The results of these studies will benefit diabetes 
research both by contributing to a better understanding of the cellular 
mechanism for insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking, and also by 
structurally characterizing novel targets for the rational design of 
pharmaceutical agents with the potential to modulate cellular glucose 
uptake.<ol><ins class='diffins'>
