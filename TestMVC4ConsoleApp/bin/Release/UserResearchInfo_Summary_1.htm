		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[The focus of my research is genomic instability and how it leads to the mutations that result in human diseases such as cancer. The goal of one of the projects in my laboratory is to understand how DNA polymerases synthesize DNA accurately, and how they make mistakes that result in mutations. We study DNA mammalian DNA polymerase beta (Pol ÃŸ) because it was a relatively small, single subunit enzyme that could be easily manipulated and purified. My laboratory developed a method for assessing the activity and accuracy of rat Pol ÃŸ in bacteria. This led to the identification of a number of variants of Pol ÃŸ that synthesized DNA inaccurately. Our focus upon detailed biochemical characterization of variants of the Pol ÃŸ protein has shown that single amino acid residues that are quite distant from the active site of the enzyme are very important for accurate DNA synthesis. We found that many of these residues act at a distance in DNA positioning, nucleotide binding, and by influencing the rates of conformational changes that are important for accurate DNA synthesis. A second project is focused upon tumor-associated variants of Pol ÃŸ. Pol ÃŸ functions in base excision repair. The base excision repair system is responsible for removal of at least 10,000 DNA lesions per day. Interestingly, the Pol ÃŸ gene appears to be mutated in a large percentage of tumors. We have found that expression of the tumor-associated variants in mouse cells results in cellular transformation that has a mutational mechanism. We have shown that some of the Pol ÃŸ variants synthesize DNA inaccurately and others have no catalytic activity, but can bind to DNA and interfere with its repair. Our results suggest that the variants compromise base excision repair and lead to the induction of mutations, and suggest that base excision repair itself is a tumor suppressor mechanism.

Dr. Wackersâ€™ interest is specifically directed towards cardiac imaging of patients with acute ischemic syndromes: acute infarction and unstable angina. Radionuclide imaging is an intrinsically quantitative methodology since emanated photons generate digital image data. Quantification of images is of clinical importance since the degree of abnormalities is directly related to patientsÂ¹ prognosis and outcomes.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Work in our laboratory has shown that acute ischemia can reliably be detected by noninvasive imaging of intravenously administered radiotracers that accumulate in the heart proportional to blood flow. In acute heart attacks the area at risk for infarction can be visualized and quantified. The results and effectiveness of interventions that restore blood flow can thus be quantified noninvasively as well. We have pioneered the use of radionuclide imaging for evaluating and triaging patients with acute chest pain in the emergency department. A long time focus of research and development in our laboratory has been on the reliable and reproducible quantification of regional abnormalities in blood flow during physical and pharmacological stress.

aims and how that may impact engagement. In addition, I have begun to examine
how familiesâ€™ expectations for treatment and their perceptions related to
treatment barriers may shape their overall experience. Within the Yale Child

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Endogenous free radicals and environmental agents such as ionizing radiation induce DNA double-strand breaks. The repair of these breaks is crucial for the maintenance of genome stability. Two distinct pathways help eliminate DNA double-strand breaks. In homologous recombination, the repair of a broken DNA molecule requires an intact homologous duplex to direct the process. Alternatively, a pathway known as non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) simply rejoins the ends of the broken DNA molecule. Our research efforts focus on delineating the mechanisms of these two DNA repair pathway.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[strong]</span>Repair by homologous recombination <span style='color:red;']</span>[/strong]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>The recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks is mediated by a group of genes called the RAD52 epistasis group. In mammals, the efficiency of recombinational DNA repair is modulated by the tumour suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2, providing compelling evidence that this repair pathway functions to suppress cancer formation. Importantly, recombinational DNA repair is also required for the removal of interstrand DNA crosslinks induced by bifunctional crosslinking agents, which are commonly used to treat various malignancies. In 1994, we identified the yeast Rad51 protein, a key member of the RAD52 group, as the recombinase that mediates the â€œhomologous DNA pairing and strand exchange â€œreaction central to all recombination-dependent processes, including the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. This finding marked the beginning of studies on recombination enzymology in eukaryotic organisms and has created a much-needed experimental framework for dissecting the role of the other RAD52 group members in the recombination reaction.]</span>.

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Our research is focused on development of novel medications for cocaine and nicotine dependence. Our program seeks to bridge the gap between human laboratory studies examining the medical safety and potential efficacy of new medications for substance dependence and outpatient trials directly examining these medications in drug relapse. Among the key findings is our work on sex and menstrual cycle influences on cocaine responses in humans. To explain our novel observations on sex and menstrual cycle effects on cocaine responses, we proposed progesteroneâ€™s role as a modulator of cocaine effects. We tested this hypothesis with a series of systematic human studies ranging from human laboratory to clinical trials examining the potential utility of progesterone as a treatment for cocaine and nicotine addiction. Following those seminal contributions, progesterone is considered a key modulator of drug use behavior, and an active area of research at the international level.

Currently we are developing and evaluating a computer-based system, to provide daily cognitive and behavioral treatment (CBT) via telephone to opioid dependent patients who are receiving buprenorphine maintenance in a primary care setting.   My second line of research involves the examination of characteristics of marijuana dependence and its treatment.  Over the past several years I have been involved in a number of studies evaluating withdrawal from chronic marijuana use, effects of marijuana on the respiratory symptom, relapse following treatment, characteristics predicting treatment outcome, and contingency management for marijuana dependence.
