										<li>&lt;p&gt;Our research is driven by the need to analyze and interpret large and complex data sets in biomedical research. For example, in genome wide association studies involving thousands of individuals, millions of DNA variants are analyzed for each person. Such data offer people the opportunity to identify variants affecting disease susceptibility and develop risk prediction models to facilitate disease prevention and treatment. There are many statistical challenges arising from the analysis of such data, including the very high dimensionality, the relatively weak signals, and the need to incorporate prior knowledge and other data sets in analysis. Another example is the analysis of next generation sequence data which present even greater statistical and computational challenges. Our group has been developing statistical methods to address these challenges, such as empirical Bayes methods to borrow information across different data sets, different generalizations of Gaussian graphical models for network inference, Markov random field models for spatial and temporal modeling, and general machine learning methods for high dimensional data.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>We have focused on finding ways to improve transfusion safety. We have studied blood group alloimmunization, i.e. the development of antibodies to red blood cells that occurs in some patients after transfusion. These antibodies are important since they can make it difficult to find compatible blood. They also mediate destruction of transfused red blood cells and transfusion reactions. We found that these antibodies are more dangerous than previously thought due to their higher rate of disappearance over time than previously thought. Their disappearance causes them to become undetectable during transfusion compatibility testing, yet their levels increase dramatically following transfusion of incompatible red blood cells. We have also studied the tendency of some patients to develop more than one blood group antibody. Currently, we are investigating ways to better detect and prevent blood group antibodies.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have also studied how to better prepare and store platelets for transfusion. Platelets are small blood particles that are important in the early stages of blood clotting. Some patients develop dangerously low platelet counts and require platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding. However, we have found that platelets leak substances during blood bank storage that can mediate adverse inflammatory reactions when transfused. We are attempting to understand what causes this leakage and how to prevent it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also have recently been investigating the use of genetic testing to better predict correct doses of anticoagulant and anti-platelet drugs. Our initial focus has been on determining the advantages and disadvantages of different testing methods.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We take an interdisciplinary approach to these questions. We manipulate the physiological properties of neurons in directed ways by genetically targeted cell-specific expression of engineered proteins in transgenic animals. These engineered proteins include ion channel subunits, intracellular ionic buffers, signaling enzymes, membrane-tethered neuropeptides, and membrane-tethered peptide neurotoxins that target specific ion channel subtypes. Subsequently, we measure the effects of these manipulations on the whole-animal behavior of intact flies as well as on various physiological parameters of the manipulated neurons using cell biological, neurophysiological, functional imaging, and genomics/systems biology techniques. As model systems for addressing these issues, we study the neural circuits that control circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, sexual courtship behavior, sleep, energy metabolism, and decision making in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;melanogaster&lt;/em&gt; flies and &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; worms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also have a new project in the laboratory aimed at identifying novel analgesics from the venom of Australian funnel-web spiders.&lt;/p&gt;

We have gained valuable insights on the mechanism of virus entry in the host cell by determining the crystal structure of the envelope protein of dengue virus in two different conformations: before and after fusion of the viral and host-cell membranes. The structures reveal the molecular basis for fusion of the viral and host cell membrane in a class of viral fusion proteins that includes many other important human pathogens, such as yellow fever, hepatitis C and West Nile viruses. Current work in the laboratory focuses on completing our picture of membrane fusion in flaviviruses and in related enveloped viruses, and on understanding the molecular mechanisms of antibody neutralization of these viruses, using single-molecule approaches. Also, in a new set of projects, we aim to understand at the molecular level how innate immune receptors such as the Toll-like receptors and the Rig-I-like receptors recognize flaviviruses (and other microbes), and how this recognition is translated into an immune response.

In tissues such as pancreatic cells and hepatocytes, the mtGTP is hydrolyzed by mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M) to generate PEP.

Endothelial and smooth muscle cell-derived neuropilin-like protein (ESDN) is up-regulated in the neointima of remodeling arteries and modulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) constitute a family of cell-surface receptors, including PDGFR, EGFR, VEGFR, and FGFR, controlling a variety of cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. RTKs are activated by binding of extracellular ligands, resulting in increased tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation of target proteins.  Once activated, RTKs are ubiquitinated, internalized and targeted for degradation to the lysosomal compartment or locally destroyed in proteasomes. Many of these processes are regulated by ubiquitination, a post-traslational modifi cation where the small protein ubiquitin is covalently attached to a target protein by ubiquitin ligases such as c-Cbl. While polyubiquitination marks proteins for proteasomal degradation, mono- or multi-ubiquitination is sufficient to direct endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of membrane receptors.

All of a sudden you feel a slight ache in your body, you feel tired, and it is difficult to concentrate. Ideally, you would go home, lie down, do nothing and talk to nobody. This phenomenon, called sickness behavior, shares certain features with depression. Sickness behavior occurs when inflammatory cytokines produced by the innate immune system signal to the brain. Usually, the innate immune system produces these cytokines when faced with a pathogen. In depression, however, some patients have elevated blood levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6 in the absence of an infection. It is not known whether these immune abnormalities play a pathogenic role in depression, or if they are merely epiphenomena. The impetus behind my research is to determine how cytokines can have such profound effects on the brain, leading to changes in behavior, motivation, cognition, and mood. I believe that inflammation may be pathogenic, not just in depression, but in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. I approach this question by combining experimental immune system activation with PET imaging to determine which brain regions and which neurotransmitter systems are affected by cytokines.

										<li>										Our laboratory is interested in defining the mechanism of proteinuria
by studying podocytes, which are specialized cells that line the 
capillary loops and play a key role in maintenance of the glomerular
filtration barrier.  We have identified a network of proteins that bind
directly or indirectly to proteins that human genetic studies have implicated
to be causal for nephrotic syndrome. Through mice genetics, loss of specific
proteins in this network has demonstrated severe proteinuria, and podocyte
foot process effacement.  By utilizing fluorescently tagged proteins,we
have visualized that these proteins lie at the interface of endocytosis and the
actin cytoskeleton, and are implicated in controlling the formation and maintenance
of the glomerular filtration barrier.<ins class='diffins'> </ins>

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Research in our laboratory is aimed at understanding the nature of the biochemical changes that occur in neurons and that result in prolonged changes in the behavior of an animal or in its ability to detect specific patterns of sensory inputs. It is known that alterations of the intrinsic electrical excitability of specific neurons are the key feature of such events, and that these are caused by the short-term and long-term regulation of proteins termed ion channels.  Our laboratory has isolated the genes for multiple ion channels, and is studying both how these channels function to in the normal nervous system, and how human mutations in these channels give rise to several neurological conditions that produce severe intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;

Studies have clearly shown that this receptor has tissue-specific functions and that loss of the receptor in specific tissuess produces profound and unexpected phenotypes.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abdala’s research focus lies in the field of HIV prevention. Her past research and professional experience focused on vaccine production and diagnostics of infectious diseases including HIV infection. Dr. Abdala has used her expertise to answer epidemiological questions regarding HIV transmission through injection drug use.

										<li>&lt;p&gt;The general goal of our research is to understand how the kidney regulates the composition of the urine, especially as needed to maintain the salt (NaCl) and acid-base balance of the body. To eliminate waste products from the body, the kidney filters gigantic quantities of the plasma (over 160 quarts per day) resulting in the flow of huge quantities of water, NaCl and the base bicarbonate through the renal tubules. The first portion of each renal tubule is called the proximal tubule, and the proximal tubules are collectively responsible for reabsorbing the vast majority of the filtered NaCl, bicarbonate and water, and secreting acid in the form of ammonium ions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our lab has specifically focused on identifying the proteins involved in mediating the transport of bicarbonate, NaCl and ammonium in the proximal tubule. We found that “knockout” mice lacking one of these transport proteins have a high incidence of calcium oxalate urinary stones, the same type that is most common in human patients with kidney stones. We showed that the cause of the calcium oxalate kidney stones is a very high concentration of oxalate in the urine. We found that this kidney transport protein also plays a very crucial role in the intestine, where it secretes oxalate and thereby limits how much of ingested oxalate is absorbed and then excreted in the urine. Based on this discovery, our laboratory has been devoting increasing effort to understanding the role of transporters in governing oxalate homeostasis and excretion.  We have also been studying mechanisms by which oxalate crystals induce inflammation and thereby cause damage to the kidney and other tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>The retina is a thin layer of light-sensing neural tissue
that is located in the back of the eye. There are 6 neuronal and 1 glial cell
types in the retina. Photoreceptors are the most abundant cell type in the
mammalian retina. They respond directly to light and mediate the first step in
vision. However, photoreceptors are also the most vulnerable cell type in human
blinding diseases because many genetic mutations lead to progressive
photoreceptor death. Currently there is no treatment available for more than
100,000 Americans who suffer from the disease. Previously we found that HDAC4
gene transfer significantly prolonged the survival of photoreceptors in a mouse
model for this type of the disease. Our research interests are 1) to further
dissect out the molecular pathways for the survival effect mediated by HDAC4,
previously known to act as a transcription repressor in the nucleus. It is of
fundamental importance to understand how HDAC4 promotes neuronal survival when
it is in the cytoplasm. From a therapeutic perspective, a better understanding
of the molecular mechanism for HDAC4’s pro-survival effect may lead to a better
therapeutic intervention to save photoreceptors; 2) to perform functional
assessment in animal models whether visual function can be restored by HDAC4
gene delivery; 3) to investigate whether HDAC4 as well as other pro-survival
factors can be used to protect other retinal cell types from degeneration such
as retinal ganglion cells. Retinal ganglion cells are the primary target of

										<li>&lt;p&gt;Our research efforts are focused primarily on elucidation of molecular mechanisms of skin cancer development. This occurs in two main areas. First, we are studying how normal keratinocytes and squamous cell skin cancers regulate the process of mRNA translation, facilitating the translation of certain mRNA into proteins while inhibiting others. This post-transcriptional control of gene expression plays a critical role in many aspects of biology, but has not been fully explored in the skin. We have identified a role for the Pumilio family of RNA binding proteins in regulating apoptosis, or cell death, within the epidermis, and we are also developing systems to identify novel regulators in the epidermal response to ultratiolet light. The second major area of research is focused on how mutations in critical tumor suppressor genes such as p53 allow mutated clones of cells to expand within defined fields of skin, eventually leading to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

My laboratory utilizes multi-disciplinary approaches to investigate how blood vessels initially form, are maintained and go awry in disease.  Our research spans from cultured cells to mouse models to human samples.  We aim to gain critical insights into the pathogenesis of diverse cardiovascular pathologies and leverage these insights into novel therapeutics for human disease.&lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; are Gram-negative organisms that are known to cause severe complications, such as respiratory failure and sepsis. These infectious organisms lead to a robust immune response in attempt to clear the infectious organism, however this necessary immune response induces collateral damage to host tissues leading to life threating complications. An effective immune response to pneumonia would promote bacterial killing while limiting the collateral damage to host tissues. Mechanisms of bacterial killing and host tissue repair have been extensively studied in the past, but investigations into the mechanisms that promote bacterial killing while limiting host tissue damage are in their infancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chitinase 3-like-1 (Chil1) is a secreted protein that is known to possess anti-inflammatory and tissue repair activity in various disease states, but the role it plays in &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt; (an extracellular infection) and &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt; (an intracellular infection) are not known. My preliminary data suggests that during &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia, Chil1 limits inflammatory cell recruitment into the lung without compromising bacteria killing. Interestingly, my preliminary data suggests that during Legionella pneumonia Chil1 may play a different role on the regulation of infection.  This suggests the Chil1 balances the mechanisms of bacterial killing and host tissue damage during &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt; infection but may play a different role during &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;

										<li>&lt;p&gt;The Sansing lab studies the responses of the immune system after intracerebral hemorrhage, a devastating type of stroke that occurs when a blood vessel within the brain ruptures.  Once a hemorrhage occurs, microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, become activated.  In addition, blood leukocytes, including neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells, enter into the brain.  Each cell contributes to brain injury and recovery in different ways. Our work aims to discover which responses are injurious and should be inhibited, and which responses contribute to recovery and should be augmented.  The overall goal of our research is to identify new therapeutic targets that modulate immune responses in the brain to maximize recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
