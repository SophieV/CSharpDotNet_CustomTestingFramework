										<li><p>Dr. Brown studies memory difficulties with neurological disorders. He is studying different cognitive tests to determine which seem to best differentiate Alzheimer's related cognitive decline from non-Alzheimer's causes such as the chronic effects of medical difficulties (cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, etc.). This is important in that a patient with a medically caused form of cognitive impairment may be able to reduce decline through better control of their conditions, whereas Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease may require other forms of intervention or have different expectations for patients. Though biomarkers are also being studied, cognitive markers are also important for identifying actual symptoms of the disorder, and the need for treatment.</p>
<p>Though he has a general interest in cognition, Dr. Brown is most known for the development of the Brown Location Test which is a test of visual memory that does not require drawing skills, is not verbally encodable, and lacks a clear pattern, unlike many of the well-established visual memory tests. This has demonstrated validity in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients, and is currently being studied in a variety of other patient populations.</p>
<p>He is also further exploring measures of cognitive efficiency. The inability to think efficiently may help explain why some individuals with cognitive complaints from the real world may do well on some test batteries; even though objective third party observers have noticed their difficulties. Many neuropsychological tests may have difficulty measuring thinking efficiency because they are designed to measure one key function; whereas thinking efficiency requires multiple functions working together. This tends to rely on connectivity between areas of the brain, which is heavily reliant on white matter pathways. Thus, cognitive efficiency is an important area to study in disorders with white matter abnormalities (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis).</p>

										<li>Research in our laboratory focuses on bone biology with particular
emphasis on the fusion mechanism of macrophages, hence the
differentiation of osteoclasts and giant cells, and on the targeted
formation of new bone. We have kept an interest in studying further the
immunosuppressive role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Research in our lab focuses on the differentiation of osteoclasts,
which are multinucleated macrophages that resorb bone, with particular
emphasis on the fusion mechanism of their precursors that belong to the
mononuclear phagocyte lineage. We have generated in vivo and in vitro
macrophage fusion assays to clone MFR/SIRPalpha, the expression of
which is transiently but highly induced in macrophages at the onset of
fusion in vitro and in vivo. We have also reported CD47 as the ligand
for MFR, and CD44 as a molecule highly but transiently expressed at the
onset of fusion. Most recently, we showed that CD200 is highly
expressed in osteoclasts, but only at the onset of fusion of
macrophages, which do not express CD200. Our goal is to define the role
of these molecules in the fusion of macrophages. We have used
genome-wide cDNA microarrays to identify the genes that belong to the
fusion machinery. We are in the process of studying the function of
several of these genes. The understanding we gained about
macrophage-macrophage fusion is being applied to studies on macrophage
fusion with tumor cells and with somatic cells, such as hepatocytes.
