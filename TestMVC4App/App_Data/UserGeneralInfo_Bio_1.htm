Dr. Yeckelâ€™s affiliation with the Pierce Laboratory began through her interactions with Dr. Gary Mack, who shared with her an interest in thermoregulatory adaptations in obesity. Through collaborations with Dr. Nina Stachenfeld, Dr. Yeckel conducted research at the Pierce Laboratory, where she held a secondary appointment as a post-doctoral fellow (2005-2006). In July of 2005, Dr. Yeckel was promoted to Associate Research Scientist in Internal Medicine/Endocrinology at Yale and Research Scientist at the Pierce Laboratory. In January of 2006, Dr. Yeckel was appointed Assistant Fellow at the Pierce Laboratory.

He received his MD degree from UMDNJ <del class='diffmod'>â€“</del><ins class='diffmod'>–</ins> New Jersey Medical School and completed a residency in Emergency Medicine and a fellowship in Medical Toxicology at the University of Cincinnati, tightening his links to chemistry again. He has been an active participant at NACCT meetings since 1993.<br><br>In his previous position at the Maine Medical Center from 1195-2006 Dr. Tomassoni contributed to the growth and certification of the collaborative Northern New England Poison Center which he served as Medical Director. At MMC, Tony also created a popular med student and multi-specialty resident rotation in Clinical Toxicology. He has been an item writer for the certification exam for Specialists in Poison Information since 2000, and is the outgoing Chair of the AAPCC Medical Director<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> Committee. Tony enthusiastically supports the training and practice of non-physician toxicologists as an adjunct Senior Scientist for the Wise Laboratory of Environmental and Genetic Toxicology at the University of Southern Maine.<br><br>Through the Yale New Haven Health System he serves as Medical Director of the Yale Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP). Tony<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> early projects with YNH-CEPDR included the drafting of diagnostic and treatment guidelines for chemical and radiological emergencies. He remains passionate about the practice of clinical toxicology and promotes the recognition of the specialty and its practitioners through frequent lectures. In addition to scientific papers and abstracts, his publications include contributions to chapters in 3 toxicology texts and 2 electronic references. In addition he was the recipient of the 2008 Faculty Teaching Award from the graduation EM residents.<br><br>Tony<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> most satisfying accomplishments stem from participating in the growth of individuals and programs. He values teamwork, sharing in collaborative and creative synergism to meet partners<del class='diffmod'>â€™</del><ins class='diffmod'>’</ins> needs. He continues to sharpen his strategic planning and implementation skills learned in teaching and private enterprise, at the Maine Poison Center, as a member of the Medical Advisory Committee to the Maine Board of Pesticides Control, contributing to strategic planning in the Maine CDC<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness, the Northern New England Metropolitan Medical Response Systems Steering Committee, Emergency Medicine at Yale, as Senior Leadership at the Yale New Haven - Center for Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Response, and most recently with the American Association of Poison Control Centers. Tony<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> most exciting current project entails developing a proposal for the creation of a sustainable model medical response system to include toxicology and HazMat components for a developing nation.

										<li>										<br>Dr. Lisa Sanders is a clinician educator in the Primary Care Internal Medicine Residency Program. In addition to her work as a physician and teacher, she writes the popular Diagnosis column for the New York Times Magazine and the Think Like a Doctor column featured in the New York Times blog, The Well. Her column was the inspiration for the Fox program House MD (2004-2012) and she served as a Technical Adviser to the show. She recently published a book titled Every Patient Tells a Story: Medical Mysteries and the Art of Diagnosis. <br><br>Sanders' path to medicine was anything but traditional. As an undergraduate at the College of William and Mary, she majored in English and took a job with ABC the year after she graduated. Less than 10 years later, while working for CBS News, she won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Coverage of a Breaking News Story. But by then, Sanders said, she was ready to move on professionally and decided that of all the subjects she covered as a journalist, medicine intrigued her most.

After two years at Columbia University<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> Post-Baccalaureate Premedical Program, Sanders was accepted to the Yale School of Medicine <del class='diffmod'>â€œas</del><ins class='diffmod'>“as</ins> part of the 10 percent of the class they reserve for weirdos,<del class='diffmod'>â€</del><ins class='diffmod'>”</ins> she said. In addition to her time in the hospital, Sanders is currently researching the nutritional aspect of obesity as well as clinical decision making and the way diagnostic decisions and errors are made.

In 1972 Dr Sherwin moved to Yale University School of Medicine as a postdoctoral fellow and was subsequently appointed to the faculty in 1974. He serves as the Director of the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation as well as the Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center and the JDRF Center for the Study of Hypoglycemia at Yale. His special clinical interests include patients with type 1 diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, complicated type 2 diabetes patients, and hypoglycemia associated with diabetes. Dr Sherwinâ€™s research activities span clinical and basic research and are focused on glucose counterregulation and the immune mechanisms leading to type 1 diabetes mellitus. The studies dealing with counter regulation examine the brain glucose sensing mechanisms mediating the activation of counterregulatory responses and the impact of hypoglycemia and insulin on brain function and metabolism. Research in immunology has led to the isolation of islet-specific T cell clones from diabetic mice that adoptively transfer diabetes and studies of an islet protein linked to islet regeneration. Dr. Sherwin has served as President of the American Diabetes Association and as a member of the FDA Advisory Committee for Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs.

He is Chairman of the Yale School of Medicineâ€™s Department of Cell Biology and is the Director and founder of the Nanobiology Institute on Yaleâ€™s new West Campus. Rothman graduated from Yale College (1971) where he studied physics. He received his Ph.D. degree in biological chemistry from Harvard (1976) and was a student at Harvard Medical School from 1971 to 1973. From 1976 to 1978, he completed a fellowship in the Department of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1978 to 1988, he was a professor in the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford University. Dr. Rothman was the E.R. Squibb Professor of Molecular Biology at Princeton University (1988-1991). He founded and chaired the Department of Cellular Biochemistry and Biophysics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (1991-2004), where he held the Paul A. Marks Chair and served as Vice-Chairman of Sloan-Kettering.

Numerous kinds of tiny membrane-enveloped vesicles ferry packets of enclosed cargo. Each type of vesicle must deliver its specialized cargo to the correct destination among the maze of distinct compartments that populate the cytoplasm of a complex animal cell.  The delivery process, termed membrane fusion, is fundamental for physiology and medicine, as pathology in this process can cause metabolic, neuropsychiatric and other diseases.  Rothman reconstituted vesicle budding and fusion in a cell-free system (1984) and discovered the complex of SNARE proteins (1993) which mediates membrane fusion and affords it specificity.

										<li>Professor James Rothman, the Wallace Professor of the Biomedical Sciences at Yale University, is one of the world's most distinguished biochemists and cell biologists. He is Chairman of the Yale School of Medicineâ€™s Department of Cell Biology and is the Director and founder of the Nanobiology Institute on Yaleâ€™s new West Campus. Rothman graduated from Yale College (1971) where he studied physics. He received his Ph.D. degree in biological chemistry from Harvard (1976) and was a student at Harvard Medical School from 1971 to 1973. From 1976 to 1978, he completed a fellowship in the Department of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1978 to 1988, he was a professor in the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford University. Dr. Rothman was the E.R. Squibb Professor of Molecular Biology at Princeton University (1988-1991). He founded and chaired the Department of Cellular Biochemistry and Biophysics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (1991-2004), where he held the Paul A. Marks Chair and served as Vice-Chairman of Sloan-Kettering. Prior to coming to Yale in 2008, Dr. Rothman was the Wu Professor of Chemical Biology in the Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, and Director of Columbia Universityâ€™s Sulzberger Genome Center. <br><br> Professor Rothman discovered key molecular machinery responsible for transfer of materials among compartments within cells, providing the conceptual framework for understanding such diverse and important processes as the release of insulin into the blood, communication between nerve cells in the brain, and the entry of viruses to infect cells. Numerous kinds of tiny membrane-enveloped vesicles ferry packets of enclosed cargo. Each type of vesicle must deliver its specialized cargo to the correct destination among the maze of distinct compartments that populate the cytoplasm of a complex animal cell.  The delivery process, termed membrane fusion, is fundamental for physiology and medicine, as pathology in this process can cause metabolic, neuropsychiatric and other diseases.  Rothman reconstituted vesicle budding and fusion in a cell-free system (1984) and discovered the complex of SNARE proteins (1993) which mediates membrane fusion and affords it specificity.  He also uncovered the GTPase-switch mechanism which controls coated vesicle budding in the cell (1991). <br><br>Rothman has also contributed to other fields.  Together with Gero Miesenbock, he showed how patterns of synaptic activity in neural networks could be recorded optically using encoded synapto-pHlourins (1998).  He discovered that hsp70â€™s are ATPases (1986) and peptide binding proteins (1989), thereby revealing how these molecular chaperones cycle on and off proteins to control their folding/unfolding. On theoretical grounds, he proposed (1981) that the role of the Golgi is to iteratively purify proteins, using its cisternae like plates in a distillation tower, an idea now implicit in all models of Golgi dynamics; and he provided the first evidence of sequential processing and vectorial transport across the stack (1981-1985).  Rothmanâ€™s current research concerns the biophysics of membrane fusion and its regulation in exocytosis; the dynamics of the Golgi apparatus at super-resolution; and the use of bio-inspired design in nanotechnology.	 <br><br>Dr. Rothman has received numerous awards and honors in recognition of his work on vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion, including the King Faisal International Prize for Science (1996), the Gairdner Foundation International Award (1996), the Lounsbery Award of the National Academy of Sciences (1997), the Heineken Foundation Prize of the Netherlands Academy of Sciences (2000), the Louisa Gross Horwitz prize of Columbia University (2002), the Lasker Basic Science Award (2002), the Kavli Prize in Neuroscience (2010), the Massry Prize (2010) and the EB. Wilson Medal (2010).  He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (1993) and its Institute of Medicine (1995), and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1994).	   <br><br>October 7, 2011

 University with First
Class Honors in Economic and Urban Geography, and proceeded to graduate study

his doctorate in Urban Studies. He
currently serves as the William N. and Marie A. Beach Professor of Management
Sciences at the Yale School of Management, Professor of Public Health at the
Yale School of Medicine, and Professor of Engineering in the Yale School of
Engineering and Applied Sciences.  An
elected member of both the National Academy of Engineering (2003) and the Institute of Medicine (2004), Kaplan is an expert in
operations research, mathematical modeling and statistics who studies problems
in public policy and management.  His
recent research has focused on counterterror topics such as the tactical
prevention of suicide bombings, bioterror preparedness, and response logistics
in the event of a smallpox or anthrax attack. His work on
smallpox was awarded the 2003 Koopman Prize of the Institute for Operations
Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) Military Applications Society,
while his models evaluating suicide-bomber-detector schemes received the same award
in 2005.  Kaplan serves on the National
Academy of Sciences panel on basic research to improve intelligence analysis,
and co-directs the Daniel Rose Technion-Yale Initiative in Homeland Security
and Counter Terror Operations Research. Kaplan has also
conducted award-winning research that evaluates the effectiveness of HIV
prevention programs while developing new mathematical models for the study of
HIV transmission, prevention, and resource allocation. His empirical and
modeling research demonstrating the effectiveness of New Havenâ€™s needle exchange program remains
among the most creative and important examples of HIV prevention program
evaluation to date. Honors for his HIV-related research include induction into
the Omega Rho operations research honor society in 2000, the 2002 INFORMS
Presidentâ€™s Award recognizing work that advances the welfare of society, the
1997 Ira Hiscock Award of the Connecticut Public Health Association, the 1994
Lanchester Prize for the best publications in the operations research
literature, the 1992 Franz Edelman Award for management science achievement, the
1991 State of Connecticut Health Departmentâ€™s AIDS Leadership Award, the 2009
Charles C. Shepard Science Award from the Centers for Disease Control, and the
INFORMS Philip Morse Lectureship for 2010-11.

 

Kaplan served
twice as the Lady Davis Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalemâ€”in the School
 of Public Health and
Community Medicine in 1994, and in the Department of Statistics in 1997 -- and
is also an elected member of the Board of Governors of the Technion-Israel

prevention of suicide bombings, bioterror preparedness, and response logistics
in the event of a smallpox or anthrax attack. His work on
smallpox was awarded the 2003 Koopman Prize of the Institute for Operations
Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) Military Applications Society,
while his models evaluating suicide-bomber-detector schemes received the same award
in 2005.  Kaplan serves on the National
Academy of Sciences panel on basic research to improve intelligence analysis,
and co-directs the Daniel Rose Technion-Yale Initiative in Homeland Security
and Counter Terror Operations Research. Kaplan has also
conducted award-winning research that evaluates the effectiveness of HIV
prevention programs while developing new mathematical models for the study of
HIV transmission, prevention, and resource allocation. His empirical and
modeling research demonstrating the effectiveness of New Haven’s needle exchange program remains
among the most creative and important examples of HIV prevention program
evaluation to date. Honors for his HIV-related research include induction into
the Omega Rho operations research honor society in 2000, the 2002 INFORMS
President’s Award recognizing work that advances the welfare of society, the
1997 Ira Hiscock Award of the Connecticut Public Health Association, the 1994
Lanchester Prize for the best publications in the operations research
literature, the 1992 Franz Edelman Award for management science achievement, the
1991 State of Connecticut Health Department’s AIDS Leadership Award, the 2009
Charles C. Shepard Science Award from the Centers for Disease Control, and the
INFORMS Philip Morse Lectureship for 2010-11.

 

Kaplan served
twice as the Lady Davis Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem—in the School
 of Public Health and
Community Medicine in 1994, and in the Department of Statistics in 1997 -- and

He worked closely with David Wechsler in the development and standardization of
the WISC-R, and has published, with Nadeen Kaufman, 11 cognitive, achievement, and
neuropsychological tests, including the K-ABC, K-BIT, and K-TEA and the second
editions of these tests (KABC-II, KBIT-2, KTEA-II).  These tests are influential
worldwide, with the K-ABC and KABC-II currently being used in more than 20

or co-authored 22 texts, more than 35 book chapters, and more than 150 articles
in journals on the clinical and neuropsychological assessment of intelligence,
many of which have greatly impacted interpretation of Wechslerâ€™s IQ scales
(including the landmark 1979 text Intelligent

<br><br>The De Camilliâ€™s lab is interested in the cell
biology of neuronal synapses. His studies on
synaptic vesicle dynamics have contributed to the general fields of exocytosis
and, more recently, of endocytosis. His research has
provided insight into mechanisms of membrane fission and has revealed ways
through which membrane-associated proteins can generate, sense and stabilize
lipid bilayer curvature. His discovery and characterization of the role of
phosphoinositide metabolism in the control of endocytosis have broad
implications in the fields of phospholipid signaling and of membrane traffic. His studies of synapses have also contributed to the elucidation of pathogenetic mechanisms of human diseases.<br>

A native of Italy, De
Camilli studied at the Liceo Manzoni in Milan, earned his M.D. degree from the
University of Milano in 1972 and obtained a postgraduate degree in medical
endocrinology from the University of Pavia in Italy.  He was a postdoctoral

membrane.<br><br>Later work on this topic examined in
detail the role of low Mr GTPases in regulated exocytosis. Since
regulated exocytosis is accompanied by compensatory endocytosis of
excess membrane inserted into the apical plasmalemma, we went on to
illustrate an essential role of the actin cytoskeleton in this process
and have demonstrated that proteins required for formation of endocytic
vesicles (clathrin, adaptors, dynamin etc.) assemble at sites of
exocytosis prior to compensatory membrane retrieval.
 After
more than 30 years carrying out cell biologic research with an
impressive and accomplished group of graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows, I decided to close my laboratory in 2001 in order to focus my
interests on teaching Cell Biology and Histology to first-year medical
students.<br><br>As part of my teaching interest, I also direct the MD/PhD Program at Yale University School of Medicine.
This allows me to be involved in the education of both medical students
and graduate students. The dual degree Program is meant to provide
trainees with a broad exposure to human biology and medicine, and to an
in-depth and rigorous training in one of the scholarly disciplines
relevant to medicine. The ultimate goal of educating this group of
students is to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical
medicine.<br><br>*Palade, G.E. Intracellular Aspects of the Process

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[James Duncan, the Ebenezer K. Hunt Professor of Biomedical Engineering, has focused his research and teaching in the areas of biomedical image processing and analysis.

Duncan, who holds joint appointments in diagnostic radiology and electrical engineering, is the associate chair and director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Biomedical Engineering as well as the vice-chair for bioimaging sciences research in diagnostic radiology. He is particularly interested in the use of model-based mathematical strategies for the analysis of biomedical images. He helped pioneer the use of geometrical models for segmenting deformable (typically anatomical) objects of approximately known shape and for tracking certain forms of non-rigid object motion, and later soft tissue deformation, most notably that of the heart.

Duncan and his research team performed seminal work starting in 1987 on the use of parameterized global shape models to incorporate a notion of known prior object shape into the segmentation process using a Bayesian reasoning strategy, helping lead the way towards the use of strategies for automatically finding certain known anatomical structure from any of a variety of medical (e.g. computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound) and biological (e.g. confocal microscopy) images. 

The strategies he developed have resulted in major advances in bioimaging. He and his research collaborators have applied these strategies to locate the cortical gray matter layer and a variety of co-localized subcortical gray matter structures in the brain as well as to locate the structure near the prostate gland. More recently, Duncanâ€™s team has begun to show that these same techniques will be useful for estimating gray matter-constrained activations from functional MRI data and could help guide the recovery of quantitative biochemical information from MR spectroscopy.

Beginning in the late 1980s, Duncan also pioneered using shape features on the inner and outer surfaces of the heart wall as material tags for tracking left ventricular motion. This technique was successfully applied to other non-rigid tracking problems in cell biology and became the basis for a variety of efforts internationally. Duncan and his research team used this strategy for more sophisticated analysis in echocardiography. The teamâ€™s approach is now recognized in the medical-image-analysis community as among the first to incorporate true physical models into image analysis strategies and has helped develop a more general area of physical/biomechanical model-based re covery of both structural and functional information from biomedical images. Duncanâ€™s laboratory has also developed initial forms of these techniques to estimate brain shift during epilepsy neurosurgery and guide fractionated prostate radiotherapy, among other uses. His work has resulted in three U.S. patents.

Duncan is the principal investigator of major research funded by the National Institutes of Health. Before coming to Yale in 1983, he worked for Hughes Aircraft Company. He holds a B.S.E.E. from Lafayette College, an M.S. from the University of California at Los Angeles and a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California.

Duncan is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. He is president of the International Society for Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention and is a member of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence and the I.E.E.E.

           <br>        I have been actively involved in the
clinical translational research of colorectal cancer, and my specific area of
research interest has been on clinical drug development for colorectal cancer
and other GI malignancies. As part of this effort, I have been actively
involved in clinical trials that incorporate Chinese herbal medicines as part
of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy in order to modulate clinical activity by
reducing toxicity and enhancing efficacy.

research efforts have focused on elucidation of the mechanisms of cytotoxicity
and resistance for the antimetabolite class of antineoplastic agents.
Specifically, my research group has studied the fluoropyrimidines,
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine, the two most active single agents
currently available for the treatment of human colorectal cancer and used in
the treatment of a broad range of cancers, including breast and other GI
malignancies. Our basic research studies have provided new insights as to how
tumors become resistant to the effects of cancer chemotherapy, and his
laboratory discovered a novel translational autoregulatory mechanism that
controls the expression of the chemotherapeutic target thymidylate synthase.
Based on these molecular studies, we are also focused on the design and
development of novel treatment approaches for human cancers, with a specific
focus on colorectal cancer. I have been actively involved in the clinical
translational research of colorectal cancer, and my specific area of research
interest has been on clinical drug development for colorectal cancer and other

scholarly publications, including seven social and emotional (SEL) programs. He
is the lead developer of The RULER Approach to Social and Emotional Learning,
an evidence-based <span style='color:red;']</span>[a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_emotional_learning"]</span>social and emotional
learning<span style='color:red;']</span>[/a]</span> (SEL) program that currently is implemented in hundreds of
schools throughout the United States and abroad. The acronym RULER refers to
the five key emotion skills of Recognizing, Understanding, Labeling,
Expressing, and Regulating emotions. The RULER Approach posits that these five
skills are necessary for personal well-being, engaging learning environments,
effective leaderships, and both greater academic achievement and workplace
performance. A key aspect of The RULER Approach is that it involves training
for all stakeholders in schools, including leaders, teachers and support staff,
students and families.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>



<span style='color:red;']</span>[p "margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;="" margin-left:0in;"=""]</span>Dr. Brackettâ€™ team has received numerous
grants to conduct research on (1) the measurement of emotion skills using performance
assessment tools, particularly among educators and
students; (2) the role of
emotions in attention, memory, learning, and decision making;
(3) the mechanisms by
which emotion skills are linked to important life outcomes, including
relationship quality, mental health, academic achievement, and success in the
workplace; and (4) the impact of SEL training, including The RULER Approach, on
student, teacher, and school leader effectiveness.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>



<span style='color:red;']</span>[p "margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;="" margin-left:0in;"=""]</span>Much of Dr. Brackettâ€™s research is
being extended to different cultures, including England, Spain, Italy,
Australia, and China. Dr. Brackett created two courses on emotional
intelligence, one at Yale University for undergraduates and the other for
aspiring school leaders at Teachers College, Columbia University (with Dr.
Robin Stern). He is a member of the Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional
Learning's (CASEL) Research Advisory and Program Provider Groups.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>



<span style='color:red;']</span>[p "margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;="" margin-left:0in;"=""]</span>Dr. Brackett regularly applies his
research and programs in the field by consulting with school systems on best
practices for integrating The RULER Approach and SEL, more broadly, and with
corporations on how to embed emotional intelligence into manager and leadership
development. Tens of thousands of educators have benefited from The RULER
Approach, impacting the lives of hundreds of thousands of students and their

Yale School of Public Health. Dr. Carroll-Scott’s research focuses on the
social and contextual determinants of persistent community-level health
disparities and the application of community-based participatory research
methods to understanding and eliminating such disparities. Her work with CARE:
Community Alliance for Research and Engagement focuses on the health status of New
Haven residents – particularly the social, economic, and spatial determinants
of health  – and the impact of

Prior to joining Yale in September 2008, Amy received her doctoral degree from
the UCLA School of Public Health, where she was a Chancellor's Fellow and a Demography
trainee of the California Center for Population Research. Amy's dissertation
explored the relationships between neighborhood structural characteristics,
neighborhood-level social processes, and child health outcomes. While
at UCLA, Amy directed the Data &amp; Democracy Statewide Training Initiative at
the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, which provided free courses in
basic research skills and health assessment methodology for community leaders
in underserved communities. Prior to graduate work at UCLA, Dr.
Carroll-Scott worked for over five years studying adult and child obesity and
chronic disease risks and the effectiveness of community-based nutrition and
physical activity interventions and policy in California.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p ]</span>Dr. Carroll-Scott is the Chair of the Community Health Planning and Policy Development Section of the American Public Health Association.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>

<p >Dr. Carroll-Scott is an Associate Research Scientist at the
Yale School of Public Health. Dr. Carroll-Scottâ€™s research focuses on the
social and contextual determinants of persistent community-level health
disparities and the application of community-based participatory research
methods to understanding and eliminating such disparities. Her work with CARE:
Community Alliance for Research and Engagement focuses on the health status of New
Haven residents â€“ particularly the social, economic, and spatial determinants
of health  â€“ and the impact of
community-level chronic disease prevention interventions and policies.<br>
<br>
Prior to joining Yale in September 2008, Amy received her doctoral degree from
the UCLA School of Public Health, where she was a Chancellor's Fellow and a Demography
trainee of the California Center for Population Research. Amy's dissertation
explored the relationships between neighborhood structural characteristics,
neighborhood-level social processes, and child health outcomes. While
at UCLA, Amy directed the Data &amp; Democracy Statewide Training Initiative at
the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, which provided free courses in
basic research skills and health assessment methodology for community leaders
in underserved communities. Prior to graduate work at UCLA, Dr.
Carroll-Scott worked for over five years studying adult and child obesity and
chronic disease risks and the effectiveness of community-based nutrition and
physical activity interventions and policy in California.</p><p >Dr. Carroll-Scott is the Chair of the Community Health Planning and Policy Development Section of the American Public Health Association.<br>

Dr. Dixon also utilizes her expertise in instrument development to collaborate in projects on other diverse topics, including implementability of clinical practice guidelines, attitudes regarding privacy and confidentiality of health care information, integration of chronic illness, barriers to mediation practice, and knowledge about care options among the seriously ill, and she has created instruments to assess experience of illness over the lifespan, self-ratings of health, and career-life balance for application in health psychology studies. She has worked with international colleagues to develop and refine approaches for translating instruments from one language to another, and to assess validity of translated instruments. Drawing on these diverse measurement projects which have often involved use of complex statistical techniques such as factor analysis, Dr. Dixon has written the chapter on exploratory factor analysis through six  editions of a widely used statistics textbook.<br><br>Dr. Dixon served as a member, then as Chair, of the Human Subjects Research Review Committee at Yale School of Nursing for 17 years. She is now a member of the Yale University Faculty of Arts and Science Human Subjects Committee. As a professor, Dr. Dixon primarily teaches courses in research methods and measurement to PhD students in nursing, and she mentors PhD students, especially in relation to methods and measurement.  She also teaches a course on evaluation in the NMPL specialty. Dr. Dixon was honored to be selected by students to receive the Annie Goodrich Award for Excellence in Teaching at Yale University School of Nursing, in 2006. She feels privileged to have this opportunity to teach and collaborate with nurses of Yale, and to support the YSN mission of "better health for all people." </p>

My areas of interest involve Health, Labor, and Development Economics, Social Interactions and Networks, and Applied Econometrics and Quantitative Methods. Specifically, my research focuses on four areas: 1) fetal and early child development; 2) aging and pension policy; 3) social network interactions; and 4) happiness and individual well-being.<br /><br />My research has attracted much public media attention, including the Macmillan Report and the Economist. In the past three years, I've been awarded the Best China Paper by the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association (AAEA) China Sessions (2011), the George Warren Award by Cornell University (2012), the Outstanding Ph.D. Dissertation Award by the AAEA (2013), and the MacMillan Faculty Research Award by Yale University (2013).<br /><br />Building upon the existing literature, my research relies on long-term field observations and primary data collection experiences. I'm an active member in the research team for designing and conducting the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) longitudinal household survey and a unique real social network data collection in rural western China. I'm a Research Fellow at the <a href="http://www.iza.org/profile?key=9262" target="_blank">Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA)</a>.
