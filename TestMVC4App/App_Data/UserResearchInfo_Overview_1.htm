<span style='color:red;']</span>[li]</span>Research in our lab focuses on the differentiation of osteoclasts, which are multinucleated macrophages that resorb bone, with particular emphasis on the fusion mechanism of their precursors that belong to the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. We have generated in vivo and in vitro macrophage fusion assays to clone MFR/SIRPalpha, the expression of which is transiently but highly induced in macrophages at the onset of fusion in vitro and in vivo. We have also reported CD47 as the ligand for MFR, and CD44 as a molecule highly but transiently expressed at the onset of fusion. Most recently, we showed that CD200 is highly expressed in osteoclasts, but only at the onset of fusion of macrophages, which do not express CD200. Our goal is to define the role of these molecules in the fusion of macrophages. We have used genome-wide cDNA microarrays to identify the genes that belong to the fusion machinery. We are in the process of studying the function of several of these genes. The understanding we gained about macrophage-macrophage fusion is being applied to studies on macrophage fusion with tumor cells and with somatic cells, such as hepatocytes.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/li]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[li]</span>One of the most recent research focus in our lab has been the development of a novel approach to target the formation of new bone to specific skeletal sites.

We are most interested in studying the molecular mechanisms that mediate the differentiation of osteoblasts, which form new bone in response to mechanical ablation of marrow. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/li]</span>
<span style='color:red;']</span>[li]</span>The immunosuppressive role of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), which is a neuropeptide encoded by the same gene as the hormone calcitonin, is a line of research that we still pursue.

While calcitonin is a calcium regulatory hormone produced by C cells in the thyroid, CGRP is concentrated in sensory nerve endings in all tissues and organs. We reported that CGRP has potent immuno-suppressive activity in vivo, and in vitro by virtue of inhibiting T helper 1 lymphocytes to produce cytokines such as Interleukin 2. By targeting the expression of the CGRP gene to beta cells of the endocrine pancreas of NOD mice, which develop spontaneous diabetes, we have shown that CGRP prevents type I diabetes. This indicates that CGRP acts as a local immunoregulatory peptide. Our goal is to investigate how CGRP controls immune cells function and whether CGRP can be targeted in vivo, using genetic engineering or local delivery, so as to allow for the survival of transplanted organs, and treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/li]</span>
