										<li><p>Adhesion receptors in cell migration, cancer metastasis, and neurodegeneration<br>Our
long-term goal is to develop a comprehensive view of how cells detect
differences in their adhesive environment and translate this
information into changes in cell shape or migration. We are
particularly interested in how these processes break down in cancer and
neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Regulation of migration by adhesive cues in normal and cancer cells<br>Cells
migrate by protruding a lamellipodium, anchoring this lamellipodium to
the substrate via focal adhesion formation, contracting the cell body
to move it forward, and detaching the trailing edge. Regulation of cell
migration by adhesive cues is particularly important for organismal
development and in tissue maintenance and repair. Our work over the
past several years has identified the Abl and Arg tyrosine kinases as
essential regulators of cell migration in response to adhesive cues.
Importantly, we have demonstrated that Arg promotes lamellipodial
protrusion, inhibits adhesion, and attenuates actomyosin contractility
during integrin-mediated fibroblast migration on fibronectin. Using
biochemical approaches and 4-D time-lapse imaging, we are studying how
Abl and Arg help cells survey the adhesive landscape and coordinate the
intracellular responses required for cell migration directed toward
adhesive cues.</p>
<p>The normal control of cell migration is altered in cancer cells.
During cancer metastasis, a tumor cell must dissolve adhesions and
filamentous- (F-) actin networks and form new adhesions and F-actin
networks to migrate and invade tissue. We recently identified the
actin-regulatory protein cortactin as a substrate of Abl and Arg.
Cortactin triggers F-actin-dependent dorsal waves in fibroblasts
following PDGF treatment, resulting in adhesion dissolution, actin
reorganization, and lamellipodial protrusion. We have shown that
Abl/Arg-mediated phosphorylation of cortactin is required for this
PDGF-induced dorsal wave response. Cortactin overexpression stimulates
cell motility and its upregulation in several cancers, including breast
cancer, correlates with poor prognosis. Our most recent studies suggest
that Abl- and Arg- signaling is hyperactivated in highly invasive
breast cancer cells. We are examining how cortactin promotes cell
migration and how this process becomes activated in invasive breast
cancer cells.</p>
<p>Neuronal Morphogenesis and Degeneration<br>The100 billion neurons of
the human brain are wired together using fine extensions of the neurons
called axons and dendrites. In order to form proper connections,
growing axons and dendrites must recognize specific environmental cues
and respond by rearranging the structure of their cytoskeleton.</p>
<p>Activation of the RhoA (Rho) GTPase in developing neurons by
extracellular cues stimulates actomyosin contractility. Rho activation
induces neurite retraction, a process require for pruning and refining
neuronal connections. Inappropriate Rho activation in mature neurons
leads to dendritic spine loss and dendritic regression. We find that
Arg acts downstream of integrin adhesion receptors to activate the Rho
inhibitor p190RhoGAP, thereby inhibiting Rho in response to adhesive
cues. We have recently shown that the loss of Arg signaling through
p190RhoGAP in Arg knockout mice compromises dendritic spine shape.
These synapses fail, leading to a regression of cortical and
hippocampal dendrite arbors and memory loss.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brains exhibit significant regression of
hippocampal and cortical dendritic arbors. Importantly, dendritic arbor
loss correlates with memory impairment in AD patients, which appears
well before significant neuron death is observed. These phenotypes
mirror those observed in Arg-deficient mice. We are examining whether
Rho signaling pathways are dysregulated in mouse models of AD and
attempting to arrest dendritic regression in these mice using specific
inhibitors of Rho signaling pathway components.</p>

In preliminary analysis this appears more sensitive to MS than more traditional measures.

										<li>Metastasis is the major cause of mortality for cancer patients.
Given that alterations causing metastasis are late events and that
multiple genetic alterations occur in late stage cancers, traditional
approaches have not been fruitful in identifying genes involved in
metastasis. We have performed a genome-wide genetic screen for
mutations promoting tumor progression and metastasis in Drosophila and
have identified mutations in more than 50 genes. We have found that
apicobasal polarity mutations in collaboration with oncogenic Ras
mutation produce fly tumors with a full spectrum of metastatic
phenotypes observed in human malignant cancers. Mutation of cell
polarity genes activates JNK signaling and down-regulates the
E-cadherin/b-catenin adhesion complex. Furthermore, JNK and Ras
signaling cooperate in promoting tumor growth. The concept that
tumor-initiating alterations contribute to the development of
metastasis, provides an explanation why tumors of distinguish origins
have vast different metastatic potential.<br><br>Our work has also revealed
that tumor cells hijack normal invasive developmental process to
achieve progression. Elements of the invasion machinery, including
JNK-induced MMP expression, are shared by both developmental and tumor
invasion processes. Preventing BM degradation completely blocks both
tissue and tumor invasion, indicating that modulation of BM is
essential for invasion. The pathways regulate invasion during
development and tumor progression are excellent targets for cancer
therapy.
Our work on tumor growth have shown that tumor suppressors such as
TSC, PTEN, and LATS regulate tissue and organism size during
development and propose that deregulation of size-control mechanisms is
essential for tumorigenesis. We have showed that TSC and PTEN genes
function in the PI3K/Akt pathway and reduction of S6K activity
levitates TSC defects. These findings have helped to define one of the
major cancer pathways in humans and have lead to clinical trials for
TSC and LAM diseases.
One of our long term goal is to develop methodologies in mammals for
interrogating the genome by forward genetics. We have successfully
adapted the piggyBac transposon for transgenesis and insertional
mutagenesis in mammals. This has led to the development of a highly
efficient single transposon mutagenesis strategy and to the
near-production of the first set of genome-wide insertional mutants in
mice, which will provide an unprecedented opportunity for deciphering
mammalian biology and disease.

Species-specific restriction factors can limit the number of host organisms that retroviruses are able to infect. The tripartite motif protein, TRIM5a, is an important component of the cross-species barrier to HIV and many other retroviruses. TRIM5a likely inhibits retrovirus infection through interactions with the viral capsid protein (CA). The goal of this project is to characterize the TRIM5a-CA interaction in vitro and establish the structural basis for this interaction.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Fatty acid synthesis<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>De novo synthesis of saturated fatty acids is catalyzed by fatty acid synthase (FAS) through multiple cycles of multi-step reactions.
