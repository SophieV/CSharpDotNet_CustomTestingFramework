										<li>										Alanna Schepartz was born in New York City on January 9, 1962 and was graduated from Forest Hills High School in 1978. From 1978-1982 she attended the State University of New York@ Albany where she majored in Chemistry and carried out undergraduate research on organic electrochemistry with Shelton Bank. In 1982 Alanna moved back to NYC to attend graduate school at Columbia University and receivedher doctorate in 1987 for research on the mechanism of catalysis by the enzymecarboxypeptidase A. Alanna then traveled to the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology, where she developed chemical methods to explore the topology ofeukaryotic ribosomes and the interactions of ribosomal RNAs with antibiotics. In 1988 shejoined the Chemistry Department at Yale University where she is now the Milton Harris <del class='diffmod'>â€™29</del><ins class='diffmod'>’29</ins> Ph.D. Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. Research in the Schepartz laboratory is focused on the design and synthesis of new classes of molecules that manipulate, monitor, or mimic protein<del class='diffmod'>â€“protein</del><ins class='diffmod'>–protein</ins> and protein<del class='diffmod'>â€“DNA</del><ins class='diffmod'>–DNA</ins> interactions inside the cell. Current topics include the use of miniature proteins to identify thefunctional role of discrete protein-protein interactions and rewire cellular circuits, the use of cell permeable fluorescent dyes to image misfolded proteins or protein interactions in live cells, and the design of protein-like assemblies of <del class='diffmod'>ÃŸ</del><ins class='diffmod'>ß</ins>-peptides that are entirely devoid of alpha aminoacids. The <del class='diffmod'>ÃŸ</del><ins class='diffmod'>ß</ins>-peptide assemblies reported by the Schepartz laboratory represent thevery first example of a synthetic molecule with protein-like structure and stability.

										<li>Robert S. Sherwin. MD is the C.N.H. Professor of Medicine in the Section of Endocrinology at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, CT. He graduated from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1967. After completing his residency in internal medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital (N Y), he moved to the National Institutes of Health to undertake a fellowship in metabolism and diabetes. In 1972 Dr Sherwin moved to Yale University School of Medicine as a postdoctoral fellow and was subsequently appointed to the faculty in 1974. He serves as the Director of the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation as well as the Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center and the JDRF Center for the Study of Hypoglycemia at Yale. His special clinical interests include patients with type 1 diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, complicated type 2 diabetes patients, and hypoglycemia associated with diabetes. Dr Sherwinâ€™s research activities span clinical and basic research and are focused on glucose counterregulation and the immune mechanisms leading to type 1 diabetes mellitus. The studies dealing with counter regulation examine the brain glucose sensing mechanisms mediating the activation of counterregulatory responses and the impact of hypoglycemia and insulin on brain function and metabolism. Research in immunology has led to the isolation of islet-specific T cell clones from diabetic mice that adoptively transfer diabetes and studies of an islet protein linked to islet regeneration. Dr. Sherwin has served as President of the American Diabetes Association and as a member of the FDA Advisory Committee for Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs. He is editor of one of the major medical textbooks on diabetes mellitus and wrote the chapter on diabetes for the Cecil Textbook of Medicine. Dr. Sherwin has served as the Chairman of the Medical Science Advisory Board of the JDRF and on the editorial boards of leading diabetes and endocrine journals. He has published over 320 articles in peer-reviewed journals. Dr. Sherwin is the recipient of the American Diabetes Associationâ€™s Banting Award for lifetime scientific achievement, the Novartis Award for long-standing achievement in diabetes and 2 MERIT Awards from the NIH.

Rothman reconstituted vesicle budding and fusion in a cell-free system (1984) and discovered the complex of SNARE proteins (1993) which mediates membrane fusion and affords it specificity.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p  style="text-align:justify"]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>My lab is involved in the study of a
heredity form of osteomalacia (rickets in children) called X-linked
hypophosphatemia (XLH). While XLH is characterized by defective bone
mineralization, a paradoxical and severe mineralizing enthesopathy (entheses
are tendon and ligament insertion sites) develops in many adult patients. We
have made significant progress in understanding the pathogenesis of the
enthesopathy of XLH, as reported in our most recent publication (G Liang, LD
Katz, KL Insogna, TO Carpenter, CM Macica. A Study of the Enthesopathy  of
X-linkedHypophosphatemia. Calcified Tissue International, Volume 85 (3) 235-242,
2009). Here, we describe the first comprehensive patient survey of the
enthesopathy of XLH, which provided valuable insight into the pathogenesis of
the enthesopathy.  In this
study, we utilized the Hyp mice, the murine model of XLH.  Indeed, we have identified the Hyp
mouse as the first valid model of enthesopathy by examining those
fibrocartilagenous insertion sites most frequently targeted in the XLH patient
population studied. The primary histologic feature of the enthesopathy of the
Achilles and patellar insertion sites in the Hyp mouse was a dramatic cellular
expansion and thickening of mineralized enthesis fibrocartilage. We have thus
identified an enthesopathy in Hyp mice that closely phenocopies the human
disease. We also provide the first evidence that an expansion of mineralized
fibrocartilage may define the enthesopathy and is not due to ectopic
osteoblast-driven bone formation, as previously thought.  We additionally found that fibrocartilage cells express the
fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR3, as well as the co-receptor, Klotho.
This finding suggests that the high circulating levels of FGF-23,
characteristic of XLH and Hyp mice, (and an FGFR3 ligand), may be part of the
biochemical milieu that underlies the expansion of mineralizing enthesis
fibrocartilage. Because the pathology of XLH enthesopathy and of age and
use-dependent injuries to tendon and ligament insertion sites all involve
excessive mineralization or â€œhardeningâ€ of these sites, our newest data focuses
on the molecules that regulate this process.  Analysis of enthesis and
articular cartilage alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, the enzyme that
catalyzes the deposition of mineral, revealed significantly higher levels of
activity in Hyp mice during periods of both growth and adulthood. This is
consistent with the elevated serum ALP activity reported in patients with XLH
and in Hyp mice, a finding we have confirmed. Immunohistochemical analysis
of ALP protein suggests the presence of two biochemically distinct isoforms of
ALP that we refer to as osteoblast ALP and chondrocyte ALP. We propose that
because articular cartilage and fibrocartilage are avascular, limited
phosphoester substrate availability would favor an enzyme with a low Michaelis
constant (Km) for phosphoester substrates. This, along with an increase in ALP
activity, may account for the ability of chondrocytes to hypermineralize in a
rachitic environment. We are working in collaboration with the Keck facility at
Yale to characterize the alkaline phosphatase enzyme we have isolated from the
long bones of Hyp mice. Finally, mineralizing fibrocartilage cells and
articular cartilage specifically express osteopontin (OPN), a highly
phosphorylated osteoblast glycoprotein, the levels of which are regulated by
extracellular pyrophosphate (ePPi). It has recently been shown that
phosphorylated OPN and ePPi act together to synergistically inhibit
mineralization. We found that while OPN levels are highly elevated in
osteoblasts of Hyp mice, OPN is absent in the mineralized cartilage of Hyp
mice. We speculate that, together with the increase in ALP activity, the loss
of OPN from cartilage might underlie the hypermineralization of cartilages by
reducing inhibitory constraint of OPN, explaining the paradox of inappropriate
mineralization of cartilage tissue in a rachitic environment.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>

</p><p  style="text-align:justify"><p>My lab is involved in the study of a
heredity form of osteomalacia (rickets in children) called X-linked
hypophosphatemia (XLH). While XLH is characterized by defective bone
mineralization, a paradoxical and severe mineralizing enthesopathy (entheses
are tendon and ligament insertion sites) develops in many adult patients. We
have made significant progress in understanding the pathogenesis of the
enthesopathy of XLH, as reported in our most recent publication (G Liang, LD
Katz, KL Insogna, TO Carpenter, CM Macica. A Study of the Enthesopathy  of
X-linkedHypophosphatemia. Calcified Tissue International, Volume 85 (3) 235-242,
2009). Here, we describe the first comprehensive patient survey of the
enthesopathy of XLH, which provided valuable insight into the pathogenesis of
the enthesopathy.  In this
study, we utilized the Hyp mice, the murine model of XLH.  Indeed, we have identified the Hyp
mouse as the first valid model of enthesopathy by examining those
fibrocartilagenous insertion sites most frequently targeted in the XLH patient
population studied. The primary histologic feature of the enthesopathy of the
Achilles and patellar insertion sites in the Hyp mouse was a dramatic cellular
expansion and thickening of mineralized enthesis fibrocartilage. We have thus
identified an enthesopathy in Hyp mice that closely phenocopies the human
disease. We also provide the first evidence that an expansion of mineralized
fibrocartilage may define the enthesopathy and is not due to ectopic
osteoblast-driven bone formation, as previously thought.  We additionally found that fibrocartilage cells express the
fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR3, as well as the co-receptor, Klotho.
This finding suggests that the high circulating levels of FGF-23,
characteristic of XLH and Hyp mice, (and an FGFR3 ligand), may be part of the
biochemical milieu that underlies the expansion of mineralizing enthesis
fibrocartilage. Because the pathology of XLH enthesopathy and of age and
use-dependent injuries to tendon and ligament insertion sites all involve
excessive mineralization or <del class='diffmod'>â€œhardeningâ€</del><ins class='diffmod'>“hardening”</ins> of these sites, our newest data focuses
on the molecules that regulate this process.  Analysis of enthesis and
articular cartilage alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, the enzyme that
catalyzes the deposition of mineral, revealed significantly higher levels of
activity in Hyp mice during periods of both growth and adulthood. This is
consistent with the elevated serum ALP activity reported in patients with XLH
and in Hyp mice, a finding we have confirmed. Immunohistochemical analysis
of ALP protein suggests the presence of two biochemically distinct isoforms of
ALP that we refer to as osteoblast ALP and chondrocyte ALP. We propose that
because articular cartilage and fibrocartilage are avascular, limited
phosphoester substrate availability would favor an enzyme with a low Michaelis
constant (Km) for phosphoester substrates. This, along with an increase in ALP
activity, may account for the ability of chondrocytes to hypermineralize in a
rachitic environment. We are working in collaboration with the Keck facility at
Yale to characterize the alkaline phosphatase enzyme we have isolated from the
long bones of Hyp mice. Finally, mineralizing fibrocartilage cells and
articular cartilage specifically express osteopontin (OPN), a highly
phosphorylated osteoblast glycoprotein, the levels of which are regulated by
extracellular pyrophosphate (ePPi). It has recently been shown that
phosphorylated OPN and ePPi act together to synergistically inhibit
mineralization. We found that while OPN levels are highly elevated in
osteoblasts of Hyp mice, OPN is absent in the mineralized cartilage of Hyp
mice. We speculate that, together with the increase in ALP activity, the loss
of OPN from cartilage might underlie the hypermineralization of cartilages by
reducing inhibitory constraint of OPN, explaining the paradox of inappropriate
mineralization of cartilage tissue in a rachitic environment.</p></p>

										<li>										Sara Rockwell received her B.S. in Physics in from Penn State in 1965 and her Ph.D. in Biophysics from Stanford in 1971.  She received postdoctoral training as a Damon Runyon Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University and as an Attache de Recherche at the Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, France. In 1974 she joined the faculty of the Yale University School of Medicine and is now Professor of Therapeutic Radiology and Pharmacology. Professor Rockwell teaches radiation biology, pharmacology, cancer biology, ethics, and career development skills in several Yale courses and lecture series.  Her laboratory research focuses on studying the unphysiological microenvironments of cells within solid tumors, with the goal of improving the treatment of cancer. She was among the first researchers to study the effects of hypoxia on the response of malignant cells in culture and solid tumors in vivo to radiation, anticancer drugs, and combined modality therapy and among the first to consider the implications of the hypoxia found in microscopic tumors for the development and evolution of solid malignancies. The results of this research have been published in over 200 scientific publications and presented in over 250 papers at national and international scientific meetings. Professor Rockwell has received numerous awards for her educational and research activities, including election to membership in the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering and selection as a Fellow of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).   <br><br>Professor Rockwell has served on advisory panels for the NIH, DOD, NASA, OSTP and other governmental agencies, the American Cancer Society, other voluntary health organizations, and several universities.  She served a two-year term as chair of the NCI Initial Review Group for Clinical Research Studies. She is an active member of several professional societies and has served on the editorial boards of five scientific journals. She currently serves as the Editor-in-Chief of Radiation Research, the official journal of the Radiation Research Society and the preeminent multidisciplinary journal in the radiation sciences.   <br><br>Dr. Rockwell also serves as the Associate Dean for Scientific Affairs for the Yale School of Medicine. She directs the Evaluation Program for the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (Yale<del class='diffmod'>â€™s</del><ins class='diffmod'>’s</ins> CTSA), serves on the executive committee of the YCCI, and represents the YCCI on several committees of the national CTSA network.

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[Dr. Pandaâ€™s research focuses on defects of the innate immunity arm in older adults. Aging is associated with a progressive decline in immune function (immunosenescence) resulting in increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections and decreased response to vaccines. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns on microbes and are key to triggering antimicrobial host defense responses. Deficiencies in human TLR signaling lead to increased severity of several diseases, including sepsis, immunodeficiencies, atherosclerosis and asthma. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the major antigen presenting cells responsible for initiating an immune response. However, DC functions in aging have not been studied in detail. Dr. Panda recently demonstrated a generalized defect in TLR function in DCs from older individuals. As a Beeson Fellow he will study the mechanism of decreased TLR function in dendritic cells of older adults. His preliminary studies indicate a potential role of the chaperone Protein Associated with Toll-like receptor 4 (PRAT4A) in mediating the age-associated defects observed in TLR expression. He will study the effect of age on the expression of PRAT4A in dendritic cells in a large cohort of young (20-30 years) and older (= 65 years) adults. He hypothesizes that the expression of PRAT4A is decreased with aging and therefore is a potential target for therapeutic intervention. In addition he will study underlying mechanisms of diminished PRAT4A and TLR1 expression in older adults. The proposed studies will be accomplished using multicolor flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, gene expression and transfection studies.
Ultimately, he hopes that his work will help explain the deterioration of immunity seen in older adults, and aid in the rational development of novel treatments and vaccines geared specifically towards older adults. â€œMy research will benefit almost two million older adults hospitalized with an infectious disease each year in the United States.â€<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>Dr. Panda has a track record in geriatric medicine and research.

										<li>Dr. Maihle received her Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences from Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and completed postdoctoral training at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the National Cancer Institute. She was a faculty member at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) for 15 years, before assuming her current position in 2003 as Professor of Ob/Gyn &amp; Reproductive Sciences, supported by a 'Senior Women in Medicine Professorship,' at Yale University School of Medicine. <br><br>Studies in Dr. Maihleâ€™s laboratory are focused on the discovery of disruptive innovations in the rapidly emerging field of precision medicine -- innovations in molecular diagnostics that will allow the more efficient coupling of new, biologically-targeted therapeutics to the right cancer patients. The clinical application of such discoveries will require the development of new business models in academic medicine - models that forge more effective partnerships between the public and private sectors. Dr. Maihle recently has completed a Visiting Scholarship at Harvardâ€™s MGH Cancer Center and Harvard Business School, where she has been exploring new paradigms for the development of such models. <br><br>Dr. Maihle has served as a mentor and role model for many successful students, residents, fellows, and visiting professors, and has been particularly active as an advocate for women and other underrepresented individuals. Her educational philosophy was shaped by C. Roland Christensen and other instructors in the Harvard Macy Instituteâ€™s educational curriculum  where she learned about adult learning theories and the case-based method of teaching. She founded the first interdisciplinary training program at the Mayo Clinic in Cancer Biology, receiving multiple teaching awards and recognition for her pioneering leadership in this novel program. <br><br>Since that time she has served in a leadership capacity for numerous educational and cancer research organizations throughout the country, and also for several national research funding organizations. She currently serves as a member of the Board of Scientific Counselors for the U. S. National Cancer Institute.

--]</span> <span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Dr. Zhiwei Hu is a Research
Scientist (Research Associate Professor) in the Department of Obstetrics,
Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Hu
received his M.D. and Dental degree with honors from Jiangxi Medical College,
Nanchang, China in 1991 and his Masterâ€™s degree in Tumor Immunology from the
same institution in 1994. In 1997 he received his Ph.D. degree in Tumor
Immunobiology from Hunan Medical University, which was originally founded as
Hsiang-ya Medical College in 1910â€™s by Yale missionaries known as Yale-China
Association.  During 1997-1999, he
held an assistant professor and lecturer position at The Cancer Research
Institute of Hunan Medical University. From 1998-2000 he was a postdoctoral associate at the Department of Molecular Biophysics and
Biochemistry (MB&B) of Yale School of Medicine, where he co-invented a
neovascular- and cancer cell-targeted immunoconjugate, later called an Icon. In
2000 he was promoted to research faculty as Associate Research Scientist in the
Yale Dept. MB&B, and then to Research Scientist in 2002. In October 2007 Hu lab moved to the Yale Dept. of Ob/Gyn. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>



<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Dr. Hu is one of first few
scientists who proposed to target both the tumor cells and tumor neovasculature
for development of novel dual neovascular- and cancer cell-targeted therapy for
cancer. The Icon that Dr. Hu co-invented has been tested for immunotherapy of
cancer, macular degeneration and endometriosis in preclinical studies as well
as in Phase I clinical trial (for macular degeneration patients). Recently his
laboratory developed another targeted therapeutics, namely factor VII
(fVII)-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) using fVII peptides-conjugated
photosensitizer verteporfin or Sn (IV) chlorin e6 for cancer (including
chemoresistant breast cancer) and macular degeneration. As co-inventor Dr. Hu
holds 4 US patents of Icon and its uses. Currently his laboratory is focusing
on further elucidating the mechanisms of action and improving the efficacy of
fVII-targeted immunotherapy and PDT for human cancers. His laboratory is also studying tumor
angiogenesis, natural killer cells and cancer stem cells and their interaction
in tumor microenvironment. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>



<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Dr. Hu is member of the
Yale Cancer Center, American Association for Cancer Research, and The American
Association of Immunologists. He is an Adjunct Professor of Sichuan University
School of Medicine and Nanchang University School of Medicine in China, and a
Scientific Advisor for Iconic Therapeutics Inc, a Yale startup biotech company
in Atlanta, GA. In 2011 he was elected as Vice President of the Chinese
Association for Science and Technology in Connecticut (CAST-CT). Dr. Hu is a
peer reviewer for numerous scientific journals in immunology, photodynamic
therapy and cancer research and serves as an editor or editorial (review)/board
member of <span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>The Journal of Immune Based Therapies, Vaccines and Antimicrobials<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>,<span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span> <span style='color:red;']</span>[/em]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[em]</span>The Journal of

Scientist (Research Associate Professor) in the Department of Obstetrics,
Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Hu
received his M.D. and Dental degree with honors from Jiangxi Medical College,
Nanchang, China in 1991 and his Master’s degree in Tumor Immunology from the
same institution in 1994. In 1997 he received his Ph.D. degree in Tumor
Immunobiology from Hunan Medical University, which was originally founded as
Hsiang-ya Medical College in 1910’s by Yale missionaries known as Yale-China
Association.  During 1997-1999, he
held an assistant professor and lecturer position at The Cancer Research
Institute of Hunan Medical University. From 1998-2000 he was a postdoctoral associate at the Department of Molecular Biophysics and
Biochemistry (MB&B) of Yale School of Medicine, where he co-invented a
neovascular- and cancer cell-targeted immunoconjugate, later called an Icon. In
2000 he was promoted to research faculty as Associate Research Scientist in the
Yale Dept. MB&B, and then to Research Scientist in 2002. In October 2007 Hu lab moved to the Yale Dept. of Ob/Gyn. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>



<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>Dr. Hu is one of first few
scientists who proposed to target both the tumor cells and tumor neovasculature
for development of novel dual neovascular- and cancer cell-targeted therapy for
cancer. The Icon that Dr. Hu co-invented has been tested for immunotherapy of
cancer, macular degeneration and endometriosis in preclinical studies as well
as in Phase I clinical trial (for macular degeneration patients). Recently his
laboratory developed another targeted therapeutics, namely factor VII
(fVII)-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) using fVII peptides-conjugated
photosensitizer verteporfin or Sn (IV) chlorin e6 for cancer (including
chemoresistant breast cancer) and macular degeneration. As co-inventor Dr. Hu
holds 4 US patents of Icon and its uses. Currently his laboratory is focusing
on further elucidating the mechanisms of action and improving the efficacy of
fVII-targeted immunotherapy and PDT for human cancers. His laboratory is also studying tumor
angiogenesis, natural killer cells and cancer stem cells and their interaction
in tumor microenvironment. <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>

his doctorate in Urban Studies. He
currently serves as the William N. and Marie A. Beach Professor of Management
Sciences at the Yale School of Management, Professor of Public Health at the
Yale School of Medicine, and Professor of Engineering in the Yale School of
Engineering and Applied Sciences.  An
elected member of both the National Academy of Engineering (2003) and the Institute of Medicine (2004), Kaplan is an expert in
operations research, mathematical modeling and statistics who studies problems
in public policy and management.  His
recent research has focused on counterterror topics such as the tactical
prevention of suicide bombings, bioterror preparedness, and response logistics
in the event of a smallpox or anthrax attack. His work on
smallpox was awarded the 2003 Koopman Prize of the Institute for Operations
Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) Military Applications Society,
while his models evaluating suicide-bomber-detector schemes received the same award
in 2005.  Kaplan serves on the National
Academy of Sciences panel on basic research to improve intelligence analysis,
and co-directs the Daniel Rose Technion-Yale Initiative in Homeland Security
and Counter Terror Operations Research. Kaplan has also
conducted award-winning research that evaluates the effectiveness of HIV
prevention programs while developing new mathematical models for the study of
HIV transmission, prevention, and resource allocation. His empirical and
modeling research demonstrating the effectiveness of New Havenâ€™s needle exchange program remains
among the most creative and important examples of HIV prevention program
evaluation to date. Honors for his HIV-related research include induction into
the Omega Rho operations research honor society in 2000, the 2002 INFORMS
Presidentâ€™s Award recognizing work that advances the welfare of society, the
1997 Ira Hiscock Award of the Connecticut Public Health Association, the 1994

		Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<span style='color:red;']</span>[James Duncan, the Ebenezer K. Hunt Professor of Biomedical Engineering, has focused his research and teaching in the areas of biomedical image processing and analysis.

Duncan, who holds joint appointments in diagnostic radiology and electrical engineering, is the associate chair and director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Biomedical Engineering as well as the vice-chair for bioimaging sciences research in diagnostic radiology. He is particularly interested in the use of model-based mathematical strategies for the analysis of biomedical images. He helped pioneer the use of geometrical models for segmenting deformable (typically anatomical) objects of approximately known shape and for tracking certain forms of non-rigid object motion, and later soft tissue deformation, most notably that of the heart.

Duncan and his research team performed seminal work starting in 1987 on the use of parameterized global shape models to incorporate a notion of known prior object shape into the segmentation process using a Bayesian reasoning strategy, helping lead the way towards the use of strategies for automatically finding certain known anatomical structure from any of a variety of medical (e.g. computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound) and biological (e.g. confocal microscopy) images. 

The strategies he developed have resulted in major advances in bioimaging. He and his research collaborators have applied these strategies to locate the cortical gray matter layer and a variety of co-localized subcortical gray matter structures in the brain as well as to locate the structure near the prostate gland. More recently, Duncanâ€™s team has begun to show that these same techniques will be useful for estimating gray matter-constrained activations from functional MRI data and could help guide the recovery of quantitative biochemical information from MR spectroscopy.

Beginning in the late 1980s, Duncan also pioneered using shape features on the inner and outer surfaces of the heart wall as material tags for tracking left ventricular motion. This technique was successfully applied to other non-rigid tracking problems in cell biology and became the basis for a variety of efforts internationally. Duncan and his research team used this strategy for more sophisticated analysis in echocardiography. The teamâ€™s approach is now recognized in the medical-image-analysis community as among the first to incorporate true physical models into image analysis strategies and has helped develop a more general area of physical/biomechanical model-based re covery of both structural and functional information from biomedical images. Duncanâ€™s laboratory has also developed initial forms of these techniques to estimate brain shift during epilepsy neurosurgery and guide fractionated prostate radiotherapy, among other uses. His work has resulted in three U.S. patents.

Duncan is the principal investigator of major research funded by the National Institutes of Health. Before coming to Yale in 1983, he worked for Hughes Aircraft Company. He holds a B.S.E.E. from Lafayette College, an M.S. from the University of California at Los Angeles and a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California.

Duncan is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. He is president of the International Society for Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention and is a member of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence and the I.E.E.E.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[p]</span>The goal of research in my lab is to understand how the
status of lysosomes is sensed and how lysosomal function is regulated to meet
cellular demands. The basic building blocks (amino acids, sugars, lipids
and nucleotides) released by degradation of lysosomal substrates represent
important sources of energy during starvation and of material for new
macromolecule synthesis to support cell growth and/or remodeling. Conversely,
lysosomes are critical for the turnover and clearance from cells of damaged
organelles and protein aggregates. The importance of maintaining optimal
lysosomal function is illustrated by contributions of lysosome dysfunction to human
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease
and lysosomal storage disorders such as Battenâ€™s disease. Furthermore, the
role played by lysosomes in sensing cellular energy and nutrient levels and
transducing this information into signals controlling growth represents a potential
therapeutic target in cancer. With this growing appreciation of the roles
played by lysosomes in health and disease, we ultimately seek to address the
following fundamental questions: <span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>

Brackett</strong>, Ph.D., is a Research Scientist in the Department of
Psychology at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University">Yale University</a>.
He also is Deputy Director of Yale's Health, Emotion and Behavior Laboratory
and Faculty, Fellow in the Edward Zigler Center in Child Development and Social
Policy.



<p "margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;="" margin-left:0in;"="">Dr. Brackett is an author on over 80
scholarly publications, including seven social and emotional (SEL) programs. He
is the lead developer of The RULER Approach to Social and Emotional Learning,
an evidence-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_emotional_learning">social and emotional
learning</a> (SEL) program that currently is implemented in hundreds of
schools throughout the United States and abroad. The acronym RULER refers to
the five key emotion skills of Recognizing, Understanding, Labeling,
Expressing, and Regulating emotions. The RULER Approach posits that these five
skills are necessary for personal well-being, engaging learning environments,
effective leaderships, and both greater academic achievement and workplace
performance. A key aspect of The RULER Approach is that it involves training
for all stakeholders in schools, including leaders, teachers and support staff,
students and families.</p>

neighborhood-level social processes, and child health outcomes. While
at UCLA, Amy directed the Data &amp; Democracy Statewide Training Initiative at
the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, which provided free courses in
basic research skills and health assessment methodology for community leaders
in underserved communities. Prior to graduate work at UCLA, Dr.

Yale School of Public Health. Dr. Carroll-Scott’s research focuses on the
social and contextual determinants of persistent community-level health
disparities and the application of community-based participatory research
methods to understanding and eliminating such disparities. Her work with CARE:
Community Alliance for Research and Engagement focuses on the health status of New
Haven residents – particularly the social, economic, and spatial determinants
of health  – and the impact of

Prior to joining Yale in September 2008, Amy received her doctoral degree from
the UCLA School of Public Health, where she was a Chancellor's Fellow and a Demography
trainee of the California Center for Population Research. Amy's dissertation
explored the relationships between neighborhood structural characteristics,
neighborhood-level social processes, and child health outcomes. While
at UCLA, Amy directed the Data &amp; Democracy Statewide Training Initiative at
the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, which provided free courses in
basic research skills and health assessment methodology for community leaders
in underserved communities. Prior to graduate work at UCLA, Dr.
Carroll-Scott worked for over five years studying adult and child obesity and
chronic disease risks and the effectiveness of community-based nutrition and
physical activity interventions and policy in California.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p ]</span>Dr. Carroll-Scott is the Chair of the Community Health Planning and Policy Development Section of the American Public Health Association.<span style='color:red;']</span>[br]</span>

<p >Dr. Carroll-Scott is an Associate Research Scientist at the
Yale School of Public Health. Dr. Carroll-Scottâ€™s research focuses on the
social and contextual determinants of persistent community-level health
disparities and the application of community-based participatory research
methods to understanding and eliminating such disparities. Her work with CARE:
Community Alliance for Research and Engagement focuses on the health status of New
Haven residents â€“ particularly the social, economic, and spatial determinants
of health  â€“ and the impact of
community-level chronic disease prevention interventions and policies.<br>
<br>
Prior to joining Yale in September 2008, Amy received her doctoral degree from
the UCLA School of Public Health, where she was a Chancellor's Fellow and a Demography
trainee of the California Center for Population Research. Amy's dissertation
explored the relationships between neighborhood structural characteristics,
neighborhood-level social processes, and child health outcomes. While
at UCLA, Amy directed the Data &amp; Democracy Statewide Training Initiative at
the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, which provided free courses in
basic research skills and health assessment methodology for community leaders
in underserved communities. Prior to graduate work at UCLA, Dr.
Carroll-Scott worked for over five years studying adult and child obesity and
chronic disease risks and the effectiveness of community-based nutrition and
physical activity interventions and policy in California.</p><p >Dr. Carroll-Scott is the Chair of the Community Health Planning and Policy Development Section of the American Public Health Association.<br>

Kevin C. Oâ€™Connor is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at Yale School of
Medicine. His investigative interests are in human translational immunology and
neurology. Dr. Oâ€™Connor earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry from
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and his Ph.D. in Biochemistry at
Tufts Medical School. While at Tufts he studied the role of the developing
immune system in autoimmune pathology. In 2000 he joined the laboratory of Dr.
David Hafler at Harvard Medical School to begin his post-doctoral
training.  During this period he
initiated a program aimed at understanding the role that B cells and
autoantibodies play in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). His group
helped define the autoantibody repertoire in MS and a number of inflammatory
neurologic diseases. In 2007 he became an Assistant Professor of Neurology at
Harvard Medical School. His laboratory focused their efforts toward studying
the immune response that occurs in autoimmune tissue and certain tumors. He and
his team were among the first to characterize tertiary lymphoid tissue in germ
cell tumors. They also described the molecular characteristics of plasma cells
that populate the muscle tissue of patients with myositis. They refined the
role of Epstein-Barr virus in the MS brain and have begun to define the role of
humoral immunity in children with MS. Recently, he and his team identified a
network of B cells and antibodies that populate the MS central nervous system. His

the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and his Ph.D. in Biochemistry at
Tufts Medical School. While at Tufts he studied the role of the developing
immune system in autoimmune pathology. In 2000 he joined the laboratory of Dr.
David Hafler at Harvard Medical School to begin his post-doctoral
training.  During this period he
initiated a program aimed at understanding the role that B cells and
autoantibodies play in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). His group
helped define the autoantibody repertoire in MS and a number of inflammatory
neurologic diseases. In 2007 he became an Assistant Professor of Neurology at
Harvard Medical School. His laboratory focused their efforts toward studying
the immune response that occurs in autoimmune tissue and certain tumors. He and
his team were among the first to characterize tertiary lymphoid tissue in germ
cell tumors. They also described the molecular characteristics of plasma cells
that populate the muscle tissue of patients with myositis. They refined the
role of Epstein-Barr virus in the MS brain and have begun to define the role of
humoral immunity in children with MS. Recently, he and his team identified a
network of B cells and antibodies that populate the MS central nervous system. His

Patients with an impaired immune system either through disease or iatrogenic medications have an increased risk of developing cutaneous neoplasms.  Dr. Hanlonâ€™s clinical and research interests include the treatment of high risk skin cancer patients and studying the interaction of the skin tumor with the surrounding immune system.<br>Dr. Hanlon treats patients with sun damaged skin and pre-skin cancers known as actinic keratosis with photodynamic therapy.  Photodynamic therapy or PDT is a non-invasive treatment where a photosensitizing agent is applied to the patients affected areas of skin.  After an incubation period where the affected cells absorb the agent, the patient is exposed to a light to activate the photosensitizer thereby targeting the pre-cancerous cells. <br>Dr. Hanlon is a member of the melanoma tumor board and is interested in the treatment and management of lentigo maligna or melanoma in situ.    <br>Allison Hanlon graduated with her medical degree and doctorate in Immunology from Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  She completed her medical internship at Columbia New York Presbyterian Hospital and her dermatology residency and Mohs micrographic surgery fellowship at Vanderbilt University.

										<li>										<strong>Biographical
Info<br></strong><br>Dr. Marushchak obtaines B.Sc. from Moscow Institute
of Physics and Technology (MIPT),
Department of Molecular and Biological Physics in 2002. His diploma work was a
joint project between Institute
of High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Institute of
Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It
was numerical studies of proton tunneling effects in the active site of the
enzyme Phospholipase A2 by means of path integrals.

<br><br>In 2002 he moves into laboratory of Prof. Lennart
B-<del class='diffmod'>Ã…</del><ins class='diffmod'>Å</ins> Johannson at Ume<del class='diffmod'>Ã¥</del><ins class='diffmod'>å</ins> University to work on his Ph.D. dissertation that was
aimed at development of technique to resolve spatial organization of proteins
in the regular aggregates by means of fluorescent anisotropy and extensive
numerical analysis by means of genetic algorithm.<br><br>In 2007 Dr. Marushchak goes to Catholic Leuven
University to learn single molecule fluorescence techniques in the group of
Prof. Johan Hofkens. There he collaborates in work on measuring size of lipid
ordered domains (rafts) on GUVs by means of FCS.

<br><br>In 2009 Dr. Marushchak deeply enriches his knowledge in the
field  with a great help of Prof. Claudiu
Gradinaru at Toronto University. He works on measuring distances between donor
and acceptor dyes on double stranded DNA by means of single molecule FRET on
home built multiparameter confocal setup.
<br><br>In 2010 Dr. Marushchak joins group of Prof. James E.
Rothman at Yale to work on SNARE mediated vesicle - membrane fusion by means of
bulk and single molecule fluorescence 
using TIRF microscopy. There he learns biology, namely how to mutate,

										<li>										<p>Jane Dixon, Ph.D., is an experienced investigator, who has taught research method and conducted research at Yale University School of Nursing since 1975. Her research has focused on behavioral factors in promotion of health, and management of illness, across various populations and settings. She has been principal investigator of three major grants funded by the National Institutes of Health, and has been co-investigator on numerous others. Funding sources have included National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institute of Aging, National Cancer Institute, National Library of Medicine, Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, and Health Resources and Services Administration.<br><br>Dr. Dixon's current substantive focus is in the area of environment health, especially engagement of people in promoting healthy environment - i.e., people's concerns about environmental hazards which may affect health, and the responses to those hazards by those who are most affected. With colleagues, Dr. Dixon developed an instrument to measure people's engagement in environmental health. A foundation for this work is the formulation of an integrated model that identifies four domains of knowledge for environmental health. This integrated model is intended to unify biological and behavioral factors in environmental health research. Using this model, she has recently completed a study about community responses to particulate matter air pollution in New Haven. Dr. Dixon has also authored or co-authored several articles focused on specific environmental health issues <del class='diffmod'>â€“</del><ins class='diffmod'>–</ins> often in collaboration with students engaged in their praxis work.  Topics have included effects of air pollution and pesticide exposure on pregnancy course and/or outcomes, and the role of the school nurse in a radiation emergency during school hours.  It is an honor to collaborate in these projects initiated by students.   </p><p>Dr. Dixon also has numerous involvements in research efforts to develop new measures which are psychometrically sound. She served as site principal investigator (Yale) of a study to develop an instrument to measure self-management of adolescents with type 1 diabetes <del class='diffmod'>â€“</del><ins class='diffmod'>–</ins> with focus on the transition from family management by parents of young adolescents to growing independence of self-management in older adolescents. She also collaborated in development of Family Management Measure, an instrument to measure family management of childhood chronic illness. Dr. Dixon also utilizes her expertise in instrument development to collaborate in projects on other diverse topics, including implementability of clinical practice guidelines, attitudes regarding privacy and confidentiality of health care information, integration of chronic illness, barriers to mediation practice, and knowledge about care options among the seriously ill, and she has created instruments to assess experience of illness over the lifespan, self-ratings of health, and career-life balance for application in health psychology studies. She has worked with international colleagues to develop and refine approaches for translating instruments from one language to another, and to assess validity of translated instruments. Drawing on these diverse measurement projects which have often involved use of complex statistical techniques such as factor analysis, Dr. Dixon has written the chapter on exploratory factor analysis through six  editions of a widely used statistics textbook.<br><br>Dr. Dixon served as a member, then as Chair, of the Human Subjects Research Review Committee at Yale School of Nursing for 17 years. She is now a member of the Yale University Faculty of Arts and Science Human Subjects Committee. As a professor, Dr. Dixon primarily teaches courses in research methods and measurement to PhD students in nursing, and she mentors PhD students, especially in relation to methods and measurement.  She also teaches a course on evaluation in the NMPL specialty. Dr. Dixon was honored to be selected by students to receive the Annie Goodrich Award for Excellence in Teaching at Yale University School of Nursing, in 2006. She feels privileged to have this opportunity to teach and collaborate with nurses of Yale, and to support the YSN mission of "better health for all people." </p>

Transitions within and between these environments are common as individuals age, and their health and personal needs change. Dr. Molony identified the concept of â€œhomeâ€ as critical to understanding wellbeing within and across diverse residential settings.

<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p ]</span>JosÃ© Augusto Barreto-Filho is a Visiting
Professor of Cardiology from the Federal University of Sergipe, Brazil,
spending this year as a fellow in outcomes research. He received his cardiology
training and his Ph.D. from Universidade de Sao Paulo, investigating
chemoreflex function in human pathophysiology. Since then, his major fields of
interest had been hypertension, metabolic syndrome, the impact of growth
hormone deficiency to the cardiovascular system and acute coronary syndrome. He
is receiving mentorship from Dr. Harlan Krumholz and his research team on a
study addressing Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in young people with Acute
Myocardial Infarction (VIRGO-OSA Substudy) and in the Taxonomy Project (VIRGO).
In Brazil, he is currently associate editor of Arquivos Brasileiros de
Cardiologia and has the goal to initiate a career in outcomes research when he
returns.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>

<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span><span style='color:red;']</span>[p ]</span>José Augusto Barreto-Filho is a Visiting
Professor of Cardiology from the Federal University of Sergipe, Brazil,
spending this year as a fellow in outcomes research. He received his cardiology
training and his Ph.D. from Universidade de Sao Paulo, investigating
chemoreflex function in human pathophysiology. Since then, his major fields of
interest had been hypertension, metabolic syndrome, the impact of growth
hormone deficiency to the cardiovascular system and acute coronary syndrome. He
is receiving mentorship from Dr. Harlan Krumholz and his research team on a
study addressing Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in young people with Acute
Myocardial Infarction (VIRGO-OSA Substudy) and in the Taxonomy Project (VIRGO).
In Brazil, he is currently associate editor of Arquivos Brasileiros de
Cardiologia and has the goal to initiate a career in outcomes research when he
returns.<span style='color:red;']</span>[/p]</span>

</p><p >JosÃ© Augusto Barreto-Filho is a Visiting
Professor of Cardiology from the Federal University of Sergipe, Brazil,
spending this year as a fellow in outcomes research. He received his cardiology
training and his Ph.D. from Universidade de Sao Paulo, investigating
chemoreflex function in human pathophysiology. Since then, his major fields of
interest had been hypertension, metabolic syndrome, the impact of growth
hormone deficiency to the cardiovascular system and acute coronary syndrome. He
is receiving mentorship from Dr. Harlan Krumholz and his research team on a
study addressing Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in young people with Acute
Myocardial Infarction (VIRGO-OSA Substudy) and in the Taxonomy Project (VIRGO).
In Brazil, he is currently associate editor of Arquivos Brasileiros de
Cardiologia and has the goal to initiate a career in outcomes research when he
returns.</p>

</p><p >Jos<del class='diffmod'>Ã©</del><ins class='diffmod'>é</ins> Augusto Barreto-Filho is a Visiting
Professor of Cardiology from the Federal University of Sergipe, Brazil,
spending this year as a fellow in outcomes research. He received his cardiology
training and his Ph.D. from Universidade de Sao Paulo, investigating
chemoreflex function in human pathophysiology. Since then, his major fields of
interest had been hypertension, metabolic syndrome, the impact of growth
hormone deficiency to the cardiovascular system and acute coronary syndrome. He
is receiving mentorship from Dr. Harlan Krumholz and his research team on a
study addressing Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in young people with Acute
Myocardial Infarction (VIRGO-OSA Substudy) and in the Taxonomy Project (VIRGO).
In Brazil, he is currently associate editor of Arquivos Brasileiros de
Cardiologia and has the goal to initiate a career in outcomes research when he
returns.</p>

She stayed in Nijmegen for her doctoral training at the Biomedical MR Research Group and the department of Medical Oncology at the Radboud University Medical Center. Hetty studied physiological and neurophysiological aspects of postcancer fatigue through a comprehensive randomized-controlled trial. In addition to electromyography of the biceps brachii muscle and maximal cycling exercise tests, she applied MR imaging and spectroscopy of the human brain at 3 Tesla.
